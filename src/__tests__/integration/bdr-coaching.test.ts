[00:00] BDR: Hi Sarah, this is Mike from TechSolutions. Thanks for taking my call today.

[00:15] Prospect: Hi Mike, sure, I have a few minutes. What's this regarding?

[00:20] BDR: I appreciate the time. I'm reaching out because I noticed your company has been growing rapidly, and I wanted to discuss how companies like yours are scaling their sales operations efficiently. Are you currently facing any challenges with your sales process?

[00:35] Prospect: Well, we are growing pretty fast. Our sales team is struggling to keep up with all the leads coming in.

[00:42] BDR: That sounds like a great problem to have! Can you tell me more about what specifically is slowing them down? Is it lead qualification, follow-up, or something else?

[00:52] Prospect: Mainly qualification. We're spending too much time on leads that don't convert, and our reps are getting burned out.

[01:05] BDR: I understand completely. That's actually a common challenge I hear from growing companies. What would it mean for your team if you could qualify leads 50% faster and focus only on high-potential prospects?

[01:18] Prospect: That would be huge. We could probably double our conversion rate.

[01:25] BDR: Exactly! That's where TechSolutions comes in. We help companies like yours implement AI-powered lead qualification that pre-scores prospects before your reps even touch them. Would you be open to a 15-minute demo next week to see how this could work for your team?

[01:40] Prospect: Hmm, I'd need to check with our VP of Sales first. The budget cycle is pretty tight right now.

[01:47] BDR: I completely understand the budget concerns. Many of our clients actually found that our solution pays for itself within the first quarter through increased efficiency. How about this - let's set up a brief call with your VP next Tuesday at 2 PM, and I can show you both the ROI calculator. No commitment, just information. Does that work?

[02:05] Prospect: That sounds reasonable. Let me confirm with him and get back to you.

[02:10] BDR: Perfect! I'll send you a calendar invite for Tuesday at 2 PM, and I'll include some case studies of companies similar to yours. Thanks for your time today, Sarah!

[02:18] Prospect: Thanks Mike, talk soon.

/**
 * TDD STATUS: ❌ RED PHASE
 * 
 * All AI coaching with BDR criteria tests are currently failing because:
 * 1. BDR-specific coaching analysis is not implemented
 * 2. Integration with existing coaching system is not built
 * 3. Training data-informed scoring adjustments are not created
 * 4. Multi-program support is not implemented
 * 5. Performance optimization for real-time analysis is not done
 * 6. This is EXPECTED and REQUIRED for proper TDD
 * 
 * Required Implementations (GREEN phase):
 * - Enhanced AI prompts for BDR criteria evaluation
 * - src/services/bdrCoachingService.ts
 * - src/components/coaching/BDRScorecardPanel.tsx
 * - src/hooks/useBDRCoaching.ts
 * - Integration with existing CoachingEvaluation types
 * - Real-time performance optimization
 * - Multi-program criteria support
 * 
 * Key Requirements:
 * - Extend existing coaching without breaking current functionality
 * - Support multiple BDR training programs with different criteria
 * - Real-time analysis within 5 seconds
 * - Training data feedback loop for continuous improvement
 * - 85% accuracy alignment with manager validations
 * - Seamless UI integration with existing coaching panels
