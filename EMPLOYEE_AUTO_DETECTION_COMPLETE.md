## 🚀 How It Works Now (Automatic):

When you upload a new recording:

```
1. User uploads call recording
   ↓
2. Azure Backend processes audio
   ↓
3. Whisper transcribes the audio
   ↓
4. GPT-4 generates summary & coaching insights
   ↓
5. 🎯 NEW: Employee Detection (AUTOMATIC)
   - Analyzes transcript for employee names
   - Matches "Hi, this is [Name]" patterns
   - Uses fuzzy matching (handles typos)
   - Supports first-name-only detection
   - Links to employee profile
   ↓
6. 🎯 NEW: Scorecard Generation (AUTOMATIC)
   - Analyzes call performance
   - Generates criteria scores
   - Identifies strengths (top 3)
   - Identifies improvements (top 3)
   - Calculates overall score (0-100)
   ↓
7. ✅ Recording appears on employee profile
   ✅ Scorecard shows on profile page
   ✅ No manual intervention needed!
```

## 🧪 Test It:

### Step 1: Add a Test Employee (if needed)

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, status)
VALUES ('Sarah', 'Johnson', 'sjohnson@ecisolutions.com', 'active');
```

### Step 2: Upload a Test Recording

Upload a call where someone says:
- "Hi, this is Sarah from ECI..."
- "Sarah Johnson speaking..."
- "This is Sarah, how can I help?"

### Step 3: Wait for Processing (~2-5 minutes)

Watch for these stages:
- Uploading → Processing → Transcribing → Completed

### Step 4: Check the Profile

Navigate to Sarah's employee profile:
- Click "Employees" in the sidebar
- Find "Sarah Johnson"
- Click to view profile
- **Recording should appear automatically!**
- **Scorecard should be generated automatically!**

## 🔧 Technical Details:

### Azure Backend
- **Service**: soundscribe-backend.azurewebsites.net
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18-LTS
- **Last Deployed**: 2025-10-09
- **Status**: ✅ Running with employee auto-detection

### Key Functions
1. `postProcessEmployeeForRecording` - Orchestrates auto-detection
2. `extract-employee-name` - Supabase Edge Function for name detection
3. `generate-employee-scorecard` - Supabase Edge Function for scoring

### Detection Methods
- **Exact Match**: Full name matches exactly (95% confidence)
- **Fuzzy Match**: Handles 1-char typos like "Milan" vs "Millan" (75% confidence)
- **First Name Unique**: Only one employee with that first name (70% confidence)
- **First Name Context**: Multiple matches, uses recent history (65% confidence)
- **First Name Ambiguous**: Multiple matches, picks first (55% confidence)

### Name Patterns Detected
- "Hi, this is [Name]"

## 📝 Maintenance Notes:

### If Employee Detection Fails:

1. **Check employee exists in database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name ILIKE '%NAME%';
   ```

2. **Check transcript mentions the name**:
   ```sql
   SELECT title, employee_name, LEFT(transcript, 200)
   FROM recordings
   WHERE id = 'RECORDING_ID';
   ```

3. **Check Azure logs for errors**:
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --resource-group soundscribe-rg --name soundscribe-backend
   ```

4. **Manually link if needed**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/link-employee-recording.mjs RECORDING_ID EMPLOYEE_ID
   ```

### If Scorecard Generation Fails:

1. **Check participation record exists**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employee_call_participation
   WHERE recording_id = 'RECORDING_ID';
   ```

2. **Manually generate**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-scorecard-for-recording.mjs RECORDING_ID
   ```

## 🎓 For New Employees:

Before uploading their first recording:

1. **Add employee to database**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, status, department, role)
   VALUES ('FirstName', 'LastName', 'email@ecisolutions.com', 'active', 'Sales', 'Rep');
   ```

2. **Upload their recording** (system handles the rest automatically)

3. **Verify on profile page** (clear cache if needed)
