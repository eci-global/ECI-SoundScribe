# This is a placeholder for the test audio file
# In a real implementation, you would have an actual MP3 file here
# For now, this serves as a marker that a test audio file should be placed here

# To add a real test file:
# 1. Record a short (10-30 second) audio clip
# 2. Convert to MP3 format
# 3. Place in cypress/fixtures/test-audio.mp3
# 4. Remove this text file

# The test file should be small (< 1MB) to keep tests fast
