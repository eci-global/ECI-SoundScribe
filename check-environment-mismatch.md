# 🔍 Environment Mismatch Detected

## Issue Found
The recording ID `756c2e77-8c48-4755-9009-312d28d47189` you're trying to analyze **doesn't exist in your Supabase database**. The database is completely empty (0 recordings).

## Why You're Seeing "Introduction" Topic
You're likely seeing cached data, mock data, or data from a different environment. The Edge function is failing because the recording doesn't exist.

## Possible Causes

### 1. **Environment Mismatch**
- Your app might be pointing to a different Supabase project
- Local development vs production database mismatch
- Multiple `.env` files with different configurations

### 2. **Local Cache/Mock Data**
- Browser localStorage has cached recording data
- App is using fallback/mock data when database is empty
- React state is persisting old data

### 3. **Database Issue**
- Data was accidentally deleted
- Wrong database/project being used
- RLS policies blocking data access

## How to Fix This

### Option 1: Find the Real Recording
**Check what URL you're actually using:**
1. In the page showing "Introduction", open browser console
2. Run: `console.log(window.location.href)`
3. Check what recording ID is in the URL
4. Verify which Supabase project URL is being used

### Option 2: Upload a Test Recording
**Create new data to test with:**
1. Go to your app's upload page
2. Upload a short audio file with conversation
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Try the outline analysis on the new recording

### Option 3: Check Environment Configuration
**Verify your app is using the right database:**
1. Check `.env.local` vs `.env` vs production config
2. Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` matches your project
3. Look for any hardcoded URLs or mock data

## Immediate Debug Steps

**Run this in your browser console on the page showing the recording:**

```javascript
// Check current environment
console.log('Environment check:', {
  currentUrl: window.location.href,
  supabaseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  recordingId: window.location.pathname.match(/recordings?\/([^\/]+)/)?.[1],
  localStorage: Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.includes('recording'))
});

// Check if there's cached data
const recordingData = localStorage.getItem('currentRecording') || 
                     localStorage.getItem('recording') ||
                     sessionStorage.getItem('currentRecording');
console.log('Cached recording data:', recordingData);
```

## Expected Next Steps

1. **If you find a different recording ID** → Test with that ID
2. **If environment is wrong** → Update configuration
3. **If database is truly empty** → Upload a test recording
4. **If cache is the issue** → Clear browser data and test

The Edge function and Azure OpenAI configuration are likely fine - we just need to test with a recording that actually exists in your database!
