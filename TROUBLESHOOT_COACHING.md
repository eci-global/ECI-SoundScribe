# üîß Troubleshooting "No Coaching Analysis Available"

## Current Issue
You're seeing "No Coaching Analysis Available" because the backend Edge Functions don't have the required environment variables to generate coaching evaluations.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Verify Your OpenAI API Key
First, let's make sure your OpenAI API key is working:

```bash
# Test your OpenAI API key (use the one from your .env file)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.openai.com/v1/models
```

If this returns a list of models, your API key is valid.

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase Environment Variables

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Select your project: `qinkldgvejheppheykfl`
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Edge Functions**
4. Add these environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: `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`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: (get this from Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí service_role key)

#### Option B: Using Supabase CLI
If you can authenticate with Supabase CLI:

```bash
# First, login to Supabase
npx supabase login

# Set environment variables
npx supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=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

# Get your service role key from Supabase dashboard and set it
npx supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### Step 3: Get Your Service Role Key
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Copy the **service_role** key (NOT the anon key)
5. It should look like: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (much longer than anon key)

### Step 4: Deploy/Redeploy Edge Functions
After setting the environment variables, redeploy the functions:

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy process-recording
npx supabase functions deploy reprocess-coaching
```

### Step 5: Test with New Recording
1. Upload a new audio/video file
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Check if the CoachingCanvas now shows coaching data

### Step 6: Reprocess Existing Recordings (Optional)
If you want coaching data for existing recordings:
1. Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Coaching Setup
2. Click "Scan for Missing Data"
3. Click "Process All" to generate coaching data

## Quick Verification Commands

### Check if secrets are set (requires CLI login):
```bash
npx supabase secrets list
```

### Check function logs for errors:
```bash
npx supabase functions logs process-recording
```

### Test database connection:
```bash
node test-coaching-setup.js
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
- This is expected - we're using remote Supabase, not local
- Use the dashboard method instead of CLI

### ‚ùå "Access token not provided"
- Use the Supabase Dashboard method instead of CLI
- Or run `npx supabase login` first

### ‚ùå Still no coaching data after setup
1. Check function logs: `npx supabase functions logs process-recording`
2. Verify the recording has a transcript
3. Ensure content_type is not 'other'
4. Check enable_coaching is not false

### ‚ùå "Invalid API key" errors
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Test the key with the curl command above

## What Should Happen After Setup

‚úÖ New recordings will automatically get coaching evaluation during processing  
‚úÖ CoachingCanvas will show:
- Performance scores (talk-time ratio, objection handling, etc.)
- Strengths and areas for improvement
- Suggested response improvements
- Action items

‚úÖ You'll see real data instead of "No Coaching Analysis Available"

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Check the function logs: `npx supabase functions logs process-recording`
2. Try uploading a new recording after setting up the environment variables
3. Use the Admin Panel ‚Üí Coaching Setup to reprocess existing recordings
4. Verify your OpenAI account has available credits

The key is getting those environment variables set in the Supabase project - once that's done, everything should work automatically!
