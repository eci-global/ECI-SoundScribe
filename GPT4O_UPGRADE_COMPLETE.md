# âœ… GPT-4o Upgrade Complete!

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

Your Azure backend has been successfully upgraded from **GPT-4o-mini** to **GPT-4o** for AI analysis!

---

## âœ… What Was Done:

### 1. Environment Variable Updated
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o
```
**Status**: âœ… Confirmed in Azure App Service

### 2. Service Restarted
```bash
az webapp restart --resource-group soundscribe-rg --name soundscribe-backend
```
**Status**: âœ… Service restarted successfully

### 3. Configuration Verified
**Before**: `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-4o-mini`
**After**: `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-4o`

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Improvements:

### Quality Enhancements:
- âœ… **Better Coaching Insights**: More nuanced understanding of sales calls
- âœ… **Smarter Analysis**: Deeper comprehension of objection handling
- âœ… **More Accurate Scoring**: Better evaluation criteria assessment
- âœ… **Richer Summaries**: Captures more important details and context

### Cost Impact:
- **Previous**: ~$0.0035 per call (gpt-4o-mini)
- **Now**: ~$0.06 per call (gpt-4o)
- **Increase**: ~$0.056 per call (~17x more, but still only 6 cents!)

### Monthly Estimates:
- **100 calls/month**: $0.35 â†’ $6.00 (+$5.65/month)
- **1,000 calls/month**: $3.50 â†’ $60.00 (+$56.50/month)

## ðŸ§ª How to Test:

### Step 1: Upload a New Recording
1. Go to your application
2. Upload a test call recording
3. Wait for processing to complete (~2-5 minutes)

### Step 2: Check the Analysis Quality
Compare with previous recordings:
- **Summary**: Should be more detailed and contextual
- **Coaching Insights**: Should identify more nuanced patterns
- **Scoring**: Should be more accurate and fair
- **Strengths/Improvements**: Should be more specific and actionable

### Step 3: Monitor Azure Logs
```bash
az webapp log tail --resource-group soundscribe-rg --name soundscribe-backend
```

Look for these log lines during processing:
```
ðŸ¤– Azure OpenAI Client initialized with dual deployment strategy:
   Chat Deployment: gpt-4o (GPT for completions)
```

## ðŸ“‹ What's Still Using GPT-4o-mini:

These components were **NOT changed** (they're separate from Azure backend):

1. **Supabase Edge Functions**:
   - `extract-employee-name` (employee detection)
   - `evaluate-bdr-scorecard` (BDR scoring)
   - `analyze-support-call` (support analysis)
   - Various other Edge Functions

2. **Frontend**:
   - Sales framework generation (`src/services/salesFrameworkService.ts`)

These continue to use `gpt-4o-mini` and are independent of the Azure backend upgrade.

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Instructions (if needed):

If you want to go back to GPT-4o-mini:

```bash
# Set back to gpt-4o-mini
az webapp config appsettings set \
  --resource-group soundscribe-rg \
  --name soundscribe-backend \
  --settings AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini

# Restart service
az webapp restart \
  --resource-group soundscribe-rg \
  --name soundscribe-backend
```
