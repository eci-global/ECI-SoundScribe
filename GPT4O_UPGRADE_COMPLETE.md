# âœ… GPT-4o Upgrade Complete!

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

Your Azure backend has been successfully upgraded from **GPT-4o-mini** to **GPT-4o** for AI analysis!

---

## âœ… What Was Done:

### 1. Environment Variable Updated
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o
```
**Status**: âœ… Confirmed in Azure App Service

### 2. Service Restarted
```bash
az webapp restart --resource-group soundscribe-rg --name soundscribe-backend
```
**Status**: âœ… Service restarted successfully

### 3. Configuration Verified
**Before**: `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-4o-mini`
**After**: `AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-4o`

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Improvements:

### Quality Enhancements:
- âœ… **Better Coaching Insights**: More nuanced understanding of sales calls
- âœ… **Smarter Analysis**: Deeper comprehension of objection handling
- âœ… **More Accurate Scoring**: Better evaluation criteria assessment
- âœ… **Richer Summaries**: Captures more important details and context

### Cost Impact:
- **Previous**: ~$0.0035 per call (gpt-4o-mini)
- **Now**: ~$0.06 per call (gpt-4o)
- **Increase**: ~$0.056 per call (~17x more, but still only 6 cents!)

### Monthly Estimates:
- **100 calls/month**: $0.35 â†’ $6.00 (+$5.65/month)
- **1,000 calls/month**: $3.50 â†’ $60.00 (+$56.50/month)

---

## ðŸ§ª How to Test:

### Step 1: Upload a New Recording
1. Go to your application
2. Upload a test call recording
3. Wait for processing to complete (~2-5 minutes)

### Step 2: Check the Analysis Quality
Compare with previous recordings:
- **Summary**: Should be more detailed and contextual
- **Coaching Insights**: Should identify more nuanced patterns
- **Scoring**: Should be more accurate and fair
- **Strengths/Improvements**: Should be more specific and actionable

### Step 3: Monitor Azure Logs
```bash
az webapp log tail --resource-group soundscribe-rg --name soundscribe-backend
```

Look for these log lines during processing:
```
ðŸ¤– Azure OpenAI Client initialized with dual deployment strategy:
   Chat Deployment: gpt-4o (GPT for completions)
```

## ðŸ†• ECI Quality Framework Upgrade (2025-10-09 - Later)

After discovering the ECI Quality Framework Analysis was not loading in support mode, we identified that the `analyze-support-call` function was still using `gpt-4o-mini`.

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Updated `analyze-support-call` Edge Function** to use GPT-4o
   - Changed deployment reference from hardcoded `'gpt-4o-mini'` to environment variable
   - Updated model metadata to reflect `'gpt-4o'`

2. **Deployed Updated Function**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy analyze-support-call
   ```

### Impact:
- âœ… **Better ECI Behavior Analysis**: More accurate YES/NO/UNCERTAIN ratings
- âœ… **Richer Evidence**: More specific timestamps and contextual quotes
- âœ… **Improved Coaching**: More actionable feedback and recommendations
- âœ… **Better Escalation Detection**: More nuanced risk assessment

### Files Changed:
- `supabase/functions/analyze-support-call/index.ts` (lines 57, 268)

---

## ðŸ“‹ What's Still Using GPT-4o-mini:

These components were **NOT changed**:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Sales framework generation (`src/services/salesFrameworkService.ts`)

2. **Other Edge Functions**:
   - Various utility functions that don't require GPT-4o's advanced reasoning

All critical AI analysis functions now use GPT-4o for maximum quality.

---

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Instructions (if needed):

If you want to go back to GPT-4o-mini:

```bash
# Set back to gpt-4o-mini
az webapp config appsettings set \
  --resource-group soundscribe-rg \
  --name soundscribe-backend \
  --settings AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini

# Restart service
az webapp restart \
  --resource-group soundscribe-rg \
  --name soundscribe-backend
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria:

You'll know the upgrade is working when:
- âœ… New recordings have more detailed coaching insights
- âœ… Summaries are richer and more contextual
- âœ… Scoring feels more accurate and fair
- âœ… Azure logs show "Chat Deployment: gpt-4o"
- âœ… No processing errors occur

---

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Recommendations:

### Week 1: Quality Check
- Upload 5-10 test recordings
- Compare analysis quality with previous uploads
- Gather feedback from managers on coaching insights

### Week 2: Cost Monitoring
- Check Azure OpenAI usage in Azure Portal
- Calculate actual cost per call
- Verify it's within expected range (~$0.06/call)

### Ongoing: Performance Tracking
- Monitor average scores improving over time
- Track manager satisfaction with AI insights
- Measure time saved with better automated analysis
