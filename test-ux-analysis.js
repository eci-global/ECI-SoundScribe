Interviewer: Hello, thank you for joining us today. Can you tell us about your experience with our product?
Customer: Hi! I've been using your product for about 6 months now. Overall, it's been pretty good, but I've run into some issues.
Interviewer: What kind of issues have you encountered?
Customer: Well, the main problem is that it's quite slow sometimes, especially when I'm trying to upload large files. It can take forever.
Interviewer: I see. How does this impact your daily workflow?
Customer: It really slows me down. I often have to wait during my busiest times, which is frustrating. I've had to find workarounds.
Interviewer: What workarounds have you tried?
Customer: I usually try to upload files during off-peak hours, but that's not always possible. Sometimes I use a different tool entirely.
Interviewer: That's helpful feedback. Is there anything else about the product that you'd like to see improved?
Customer: Yes, the user interface could be more intuitive. It took me a while to figure out where everything was located.
Interviewer: Thank you for that feedback. Any final thoughts?
Customer: Overall, I think it's a solid product, but these performance and usability issues are holding it back from being great.
