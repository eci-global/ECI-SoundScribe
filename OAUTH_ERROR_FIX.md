# 🔧 Outreach OAuth Error Fix

## 🚨 **Error Analysis**
```
OAuth callback error: Error: The OAuth token exchange endpoint is not deployed. 
Please deploy the outreach-oauth edge function to Supabase or contact your administrator.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `outreach-oauth` Edge function exists in the codebase but may not be deployed to Supabase, or there's a deployment/access issue.

## ✅ **Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Deploy Missing Edge Function**
```powershell
# Change to correct directory first
cd C:\Scripts\Cursor\SoundScribe\echo-ai-scribe-app

# Deploy the OAuth function
npx supabase functions deploy outreach-oauth
```

### **Option 2: Deploy All Functions (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Deploy all Edge functions to ensure consistency
npx supabase functions deploy
```

### **Option 3: Manual Deployment (If CLI fails)**
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **Edge Functions**
2. **Create new function** named `outreach-oauth`
3. **Copy content** from `supabase/functions/outreach-oauth/index.ts`
4. **Save and deploy**

## 🧪 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check Function Exists**
In Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions, verify:
- ✅ `outreach-oauth` function is listed
- ✅ Function status is "Active"
- ✅ No deployment errors

### **2. Test OAuth Flow**
1. Go to `/integrations/outreach/connect`
2. Click "Connect to Outreach"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Should redirect back without errors

### **3. Check Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
- `OUTREACH_CLIENT_ID`
- `OUTREACH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OUTREACH_REDIRECT_URI`

## 🔄 **Related Functions to Deploy**

Since you're having deployment issues, also ensure these are deployed:
- ✅ `analyze-speakers-topics` (for Call Outline)
- ✅ `outreach-oauth` (for OAuth integration)
- ✅ `process-recording` (for audio processing)

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After successful deployment:
- ✅ Outreach OAuth integration works
- ✅ No "endpoint not deployed" errors
- ✅ Successful token exchange
- ✅ User can connect their Outreach account

## 🚨 **If Deployment Still Fails**

The OAuth error is separate from the Call Outline auto-generation. The Call Outline improvements we made should work independently. This OAuth issue only affects Outreach integration features.

**Priority:**
1. **High**: Call Outline auto-generation (✅ Fixed)
2. **Medium**: Outreach OAuth integration (needs deployment)

You can test the Call Outline improvements while working on the OAuth deployment separately.
