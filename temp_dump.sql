Fast support. Dot. L. Yep. Go to. Yeah. Fast support. Assist.com. That''s the longest website you''ll type in today here. Fast support. Go to assist. All right. Establish support connection. Yes. And it should ask for your name, and then I''ll have a session key for you. Okay. Session key is 447-653-4483. I''m sorry. 447-653-579. 579. Okay. All right. Okay. I can see your screen. Let''s take a look at what you are seeing. So I see your McCullough icon at the very bottom there. Yeah, that''s the local. And then on the Internet Explorer is the browser. Okay. So let''s see here. Let''s take a look. So when you log in in the morning, you log into your Windows environment, and then. Yeah. So the first Internet Explorer option there. Yeah, there you go. Okay. So this is how you would begin to log in, and this is where it''s filling for you? Yeah. Usually we don''t get this. So if I can close this window. Let''s see. Okay. Yep. Go on. So usually we''ll come in, open up Internet Explorer. We have the shortcut up here. Click on that, and it opens. So today everybody is getting the sign-in requirement. Okay. Let me take a screenshot of this screen. It looks like a Windows security prompt. Okay. So then if you try to put in. So you''ve never had to do this before, right? Correct. If you can hold on for one second, the IT guy is calling in on my other phone. Okay. Sounds good. Hey, Justin. Can you tell me if somebody is here? Okay. I got Nicola is on the line now. Should I tell him that? Okay. All right. I''m going to put you on hold. Okay. Hey, Reginald. I don''t know if you could hear part of that conversation, but the IT guy is saying that there''s someone on site here has plugged in a Netgear appliance, and it''s conflicting with the domain server. He believes it''s what''s causing this authentication issue, but he said it''s not a Macola issue. It''s something. Yeah. I was going to say, yeah, this doesn''t feel Macola-y. It feels kind of more network server related. Is there the number that you called me? Is that something where I can call you back if we''re not able to resolve it? It''s best to just shoot me an e-mail if you can. I sent you an e-mail through that case ID, and that will go to my personal inbox, and that will light up. So if you respond to that saying, hey, Reg, we''re all set. Let me just make sure I got it in here. Yeah, yep. We''ll take care of you there if you respond. So let me know. Yeah, keep me posted. I figured that was the route it was going to go. It''s before it gets to the actual application. It sounds network-y or server-related. Okay. Well, thanks for getting right on that. We appreciate it. No problem. Thank you, and have a good one. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**
The conversation involves Reginald from DTI support assisting Sue with a login issue related to a Windows environment. They discuss a potential network conflict caused by a Netgear appliance that is affecting authentication, rather than an issue with the application itself.

**Key Points:**
• **Support Connection Established:** Reginald guides Sue to establish a support connection through a specific website and provides a session key for assistance.  
• **Authentication Issue Identified:** Sue experiences a new sign-in requirement that has not occurred before, prompting Reginald to investigate the issue further.  
• **Network Conflict Suspected:** The IT technician suggests that a Netgear appliance is conflicting with the domain server, indicating the issue is likely network-related rather than application-related.', NULL, '{"overallScore":75,"criteria":{"talkTimeRatio":60,"objectionHandling":7,"discoveryQuestions":5,"valueArticulation":6,"activeListening":8,"nextSteps":true,"rapport":7},"strengths":["Clear communication of technical steps","Good active listening","Effective objection handling"],"improvements":["Reduce filler words","Enhance value articulation","Increase discovery questions"],"actionItems":["Follow up with an email to the client","Clarify the next steps for the IT issue","Schedule a follow-up call if necessary"],"summary":"The sales call demonstrated effective communication and active listening, but could benefit from improved value articulation and a more concise delivery."}', '2025-10-02 16:44:05.783+00', NULL, '{"summary": "The sales call demonstrated effective communication and active listening, but could benefit from improved value articulation and a more concise delivery.", "criteria": {"rapport": 7, "nextSteps": true, "talkTimeRatio": 60, "activeListening": 8, "objectionHandling": 7, "valueArticulation": 6, "discoveryQuestions": 5}, "strengths": ["Clear communication of technical steps", "Good active listening", "Effective objection handling"], "actionItems": ["Follow up with an email to the client", "Clarify the next steps for the IT issue", "Schedule a follow-up call if necessary"], "bdrInsights": {"keyStrengths": ["Basic communication skills", "Ability to follow instructions"], "nextCallFocus": ["Ask more open-ended questions", "Improve talk time balance"], "competencyLevel": "needs improvement", "improvementAreas": ["Opening could be stronger", "Need better objection handling"], "coachingPriorities": ["Focus on discovery techniques", "Enhance closing strategies"]}, "improvements": ["Reduce filler words", "Enhance value articulation", "Increase discovery questions"], "overallScore": 75, "bdrEvaluationId": "34dd3542-192b-496d-b47c-9e6254d20981", "bdrCriteriaScores": {"closing": {"score": 1, "feedback": "Closing was weak;

Hey, Justin. This is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about JobBoss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? JobBoss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, JobBoss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do coating for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with JobBoss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s gonna help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. So. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either JobBoss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you, or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. So yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand, like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to get, it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, a deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like, I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. So as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah, and you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really gonna try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really wanna focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? Like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of material, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. Yeah. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to mid-sized shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location it''s in? Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might''ve been the name that he said. So very possible. Well, let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay, well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay, thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay, you too.

He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, a window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The search function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but you have to search functionally. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server – okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been – let me just confirm. His computer had been updated. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. It''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down here. Windows 11. I wonder if there''s – there could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double-check some areas. Okay. Real quickly here. I''ve seen the article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hotfixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hotfix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade type we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I guess – I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. A little bit behind, but that''s okay. I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, or platform requirements. Okay. And then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details. But it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? If that documentation is pretty straightforward. So is it just a client upgrade, or do we need to upgrade the server database, or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But, yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review – I see that you called in the past support articles. Let me – I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start to create a case there, but I''m like, I don''t even remember creating a case or an account with you all before. So to review these articles, do I need – Yeah, let me just make sure. Ben.Illiam at TwinOaksTech.com. That''s your – That''s correct, yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t. Okay. Let me. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might can find out. Okay. Let''s see if you submitted cases in the past. I think you do have access. You should be good. Okay. Let me see if I can just. Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah. Just going to do that. Okay. I''m going to do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay. I got the portal. Receive your request. Receive your password. Nice. Nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. Get in my vault. I''ll put it in our password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right. I''m going to send you an email right now. I''ll just get in. Okay. And yep, I''m in the customer portal now. So I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Keep. Yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information.

When I get the lookup function, a window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The search function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but you have to search functionally. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server. Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm. His computer had been updated. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. It''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down here. Windows 11. I wonder if there''s... There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Real quickly here. I''ve seen the article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hotfixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hotfix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade type we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. A little bit behind, but that''s okay. I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, for platform requirements. Okay. Okay, and then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details. But it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. Okay. All right. Okay. Is there anything else I can look into for you? That documentation is pretty straightforward. So is it just a client upgrade, or do we need to upgrade the server database, or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But, yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported, operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review, I see that you called in the past, support articles? Let me, I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start to create a case there, but I''m like I don''t even remember creating a case or an account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need? Yeah, let me just make sure, bin.illiam.twinoakstech.com. That''s your? That''s correct, yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t. Okay. Let me. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might can find out. Okay. Let''s see if you submitted cases in the past. I think you do have access. You should be good. Okay. Let me see if I can just. Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah, just going to do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay. I got the portal. Receive your request. Receive your password. Nice. Nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. Get in my vault. I''ll put it in our password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right. I''m going to send you an email right now. I''ll just get in. Okay. And yep, I''m in the customer portal now. So I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Keep, yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information. If you need anything else, create a case, reach out, and we''ll take care of you. But thanks for giving us some time today. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one. You too.

A little too short, to be honest, though. Yeah, I hear you. But hey, I''m just checking in here with the team at Jobbox Square. I know that you were kind of looking into our shop management system last year, and things just kind of didn''t move forward. I was looking at the notes. I think it was kind of like either you didn''t have an actual project or maybe just didn''t have a budget. So it''s been a while, man, so I just thought it''d be a good idea to check in, see whether you landed on something different or how you were doing now. We''re good right now, but I don''t think that program works for us. Okay. What was the last thing? Sorry, I couldn''t hear. I said we''re too small to be able to utilize it effectively. Okay, I see. And when you say too small, do you mean like what exactly do you mean by that? So tell me, what was it you were offering again? It was a management tool? Yeah, I guess the technical fancy term is like an ERP, and it''s kind of like a quote-to-cash system made for small manufacturers. And that''s why I asked what you mean by small, because this is made specifically for small shops, job shops, fab shops, et cetera. What kind of cash are we talking about? I''m sorry, say that again? What kind of cost are we talking about for your system? So I wish I could answer with kind of more clarity, because I''m not kind of like the expert that kind of gets the pricing. But there''s three different tiers, and they kind of come down to like how many users you would need and stuff like that. And they go anywhere from like I''ve seen deals anywhere from two all the way up to five figures. So it just kind of depends on different things. Yeah, that''s fairly typical for ERP systems. But yeah, we are too small. There''s only three of us in here. So it would be way overkill for us. Okay. And do you think that, again, just to give you a little more context, like I''ll give you an example of someone that thought they were too small and might be smaller than you. We actually have a one-man shop. It''s not even a shop. It''s a guy working out of his garage that uses this system. The system''s called Jobbox Square. Again, just to give you an idea, you might be right. It might be too small. It''s kind of impossible for me to know, and that''s kind of why I asked, like what do you mean by too small? And what are you guys currently using now to kind of just keep track of everything? QuickBooks. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that''s kind of what like 50% of our customers use. And QuickBooks is kind of like one of our partners. So a lot of them continue using QuickBooks. It just kind of integrates with Jobbox Square, with the ERP, and they just kind of go from there. So I''m kind of – I guess my question is do you feel that if like budget wasn''t a concern, like this could be something that, you know, you would want to look into? I just cannot see an application for it for us. You see it as what for you? I said I do not see it as an application for us. Okay. And why not? It''s based on my experience with ERP systems. Okay. And have you used Jobbox Square specifically or other ERPs? Just other ERPs. Okay. So I know I''m asking you a lot of questions, man, and the reason why is it''s just kind of what we do. Like we – I''ve seen the impact that our system has. A lot of the customers that I''ve kind of helped brought in, we''ve had the same conversation. Like I think we''re just small, Abraham. Like I don''t think – I don''t know if this necessarily applies for what we do, et cetera, et cetera. So that''s kind of why I''m so curious because I see the impact that the system is making for our customers. I see that it''s helping them. It''s helping them grow. And honestly, a lot of them would even tell you that the reason why they felt that they were too small in the first place is because they weren''t using something that could kind of help streamline their growth. So, I mean, all that being said, man, it''s like because I can''t answer the questions about the pricing that well for you, I know that Holly, who''s like our expert in California, I know that she would be more than happy to have a quick conversation with you. This isn''t a, hey, let''s try to get Ian to buy the system today. It''s more of a is this something that would be helpful for him, number one? Are they really too small? Is there no need for this? And, you know, if the answer for those is like, yeah, there''s no need, this is not something that they could use, we''re not going to try to kind of move forward, let alone try to sell this to you. But we''ll try to point you in the right direction if there''s anything, like any recommendations we can make. But you never know. It might actually be something that could work for you right now as it is. I know Holly would be really happy. She loves having conversations with people just like you and kind of determining that. I mean, it''s up to you whether you''d like to take 10 minutes, 15 minutes to connect with her. If you would, I''d be more than happy to make that happen for you. There''s no harm in talking. Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, man. And also Holly, she''s been with this company for like 100 years, about 30 to be more exact. And so she knows a thing or two not just about our system, but also other systems, manufacturing, et cetera, et cetera. So let me pull up her calendar and see if I can find you guys a time that works for both of you. I think she''s pretty busy the next, like she''s pretty busy tomorrow, Thursday, Friday. She has a little bit more time for either of those days, for either Thursday or Friday. Would there be a time that you think would work for you? Yeah, around this time on Thursday. Sorry, man, say that again? I said around this time on Thursday. I''m so sorry. I couldn''t catch that. I said around 11 a.m. on Thursday. Okay, okay. 11 a.m. on Thursday. Let me see. Okay, so I think that she is free that time. Let me just put in the calendar and make sure. All right, yeah, it looks like she is open at that time. Let me just ping her just to double check. I think she has meetings scheduled around that. So let me just see if I can confirm that with her. But I think she is good for that day. And what she will be doing is she will just give you a phone call. Again, just introduce herself and kind of ask you the important questions and see if we would be a good fit as partners or not. And then based on that, she can kind of tell you, hey, I think it''s better we just kind of shake hands and part our separate ways. Or if we are a good fit, then she''ll kind of tell you what the next steps would be. And so, yeah, so she just replied to me, and she is good for Thursday, 11 a.m. Pacific time. So I''m going to send you an e-mail invite. Just do me a favor when you get it, just click accept so that it goes in your calendar and then Holly knows that you will be there. Let me make sure I got your right e-mail, Ian. Is it idober at sw-industrial.com? Yep, that''s it. All right, perfect. All right, so I''ll send that to you within the next few minutes. And, yeah, like I said, I know Holly is more than excited to chat with you, man, and I hope that we are a good fit. But even if we''re not, I really hope that she can kind of provide some value for you. All right, appreciate the call. You got it, brother. We''ll talk to you in a couple days. All right. All right, bye. Bye.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '1. **Summary**: The conversation is a sales call from Abraham at Jobbox Square to Ian at Southwest, discussing the potential fit of Jobbox''s ERP system for Ian''s small team. Although Ian expresses skepticism about the system''s utility for his three-person operation, Abraham suggests a meeting with an expert to explore the system''s applicability further.

2. **Key Topics Discussed**:
   - Introduction and casual conversation between Abraham and Ian.
   - Jobbox Square''s ERP system and its potential benefits for small businesses.
   - Ian''s concerns regarding the ERP system being too advanced for his small team.
   - Integration with existing software (QuickBooks).
   - Scheduling a follow-up meeting with an expert from Jobbox Square.

3. **Action Items Mentioned**:
   - Abraham will send an email invite for a meeting between Ian and Holly, the Jobbox Square expert.
   - Ian is to accept the meeting invite once received.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Neutral. The conversation maintains a professional tone, with both parties expressing interest in finding a solution, but Ian remains skeptical about the product''s relevance to his situation.

5. **Key Insights or Recommendations**:
   - Abraham should focus on understanding Ian''s specific needs and challenges more deeply to tailor his approach effectively.
   - Highlighting successful case studies or testimonials from similar-sized businesses could help alleviate Ian''s concerns about the ERP system being too complex.
   - The follow-up meeting with Holly should be framed as a consultation rather than a sales pitch to ensure Ian feels comfortable discussing his needs.', NULL, NULL, '{"summary": "The call demonstrated strong rapport and effective questioning, allowing for a good understanding of the client''s situation.

My name is Reginald. Have your first and last name, please. Hey, Reginald. This is Ben. Hello. Hey, Ben. How are you doing? I''m pretty good. How about yourself? Doing well. Doing well here. And how can we help? So last week, my call of software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC, I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem. But I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized. And the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose maximize on the taskbar. And it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client. And that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates, about that time. That may be a coincidence. Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben. I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your... Let''s see. What company are you working with again? I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the managed or MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO. Okay. Let me try to find... And you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients. Or they''re a tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me... Let''s see. So Clarksville is the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay. So you do have me there from a previous support. Perfect. Okay. Now I need to get these created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay. So yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9 dot, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9 dot 310. 310. Okay. All right. Sounds good. So it sounds like Windows Update issue caused window issues. So... Yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows Update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah, I''m leaning there with you. Typically, there''s a couple of... I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots, and I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares, and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression is a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything? Like not opening? Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar. And so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but yeah, the search function. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server... Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is Server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Okay. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I guess I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. It''s a little bit behind, but that''s okay. Although I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, or platform requirements. Okay. Okay, and then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details, but it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? If that documentation is pretty straightforward, so is it just a client upgrade or do we need to upgrade the server database or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported, operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review? I see that you called in the past support articles. Let me... I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start the case there, but I don''t remember creating a case or an account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need... Yeah, let me just make sure. Ben.M at TwinOaksTech.com. That''s your... That''s correct. Yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, just shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t? Okay. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might find out. Okay. Looks like you submitted cases in the past, so I think you do have access. You should be good. Let me see if I can just... Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah, just go and do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay, I got the portal. You see your request or you see your password? Nice, nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. I''ll put it in our password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right, I''m going to send you an email right now with all this good info. Okay. Yep, I''m in the customer portal now, so I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information. If you need anything else, create a case, reach out, and we''ll take care of you. But thanks for giving us some time today. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one. Bye. You too. Bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Ben contacted senior support to address issues with McCullough Progression software used by the Clarksville Economic Development Council. The problem appears to be related to compatibility issues following a Windows update, and Reginald provided troubleshooting steps, compatibility information, and relevant documentation to assist with resolving the issue.

**Key Points:**  
• **Issue Description:** Ben reported that after recent Windows updates, the McCullough Progression software minimizes and won''t restore properly, requiring manual maximization. Additional issues include window frame problems and lookup function errors.  

• **Compatibility Problem Identified:** Reginald confirmed that the McCullough Progression version 7.9.310 is not supported on Windows 11, which is likely causing the issues. He suggested reviewing platform requirements and considering an upgrade to a supported version.  

• **Next Steps and Resources:** Reginald will send documentation, including troubleshooting articles, platform requirements, and installation guides. Ben confirmed access to the customer portal to review these resources and will follow up if further assistance is needed.', NULL, '{"overallScore":85,"criteria":{"talkTimeRatio":70,"objectionHandling":8,"discoveryQuestions":12,"valueArticulation":8,"activeListening":9,"nextSteps":true,"rapport":9},"strengths":["Effective rapport building","Thorough discovery process","Clear articulation of next steps"],"improvements":["Reduce talk time ratio for better client engagement","Streamline technical explanations","Proactively address potential objections earlier"],"actionItems":["Send compatibility and upgrade documentation promptly","Ensure client has full access to the customer portal","Follow up to confirm resolution and satisfaction"],"summary":"The sales call demonstrated strong rapport building and effective discovery of client needs.

Good morning, I was looking for Jeremy. This is Jeremy. Jeremy, this is Adam over at Job Boss Squared. How have you been? Good, how have you been? I''m pretty good. But I did want to get back in touch with you. We hadn''t really talked since last year. And I''m hoping we can revisit. Yeah, now is not a good time. We''re still feeling the effects from being so slow last year. Okay. So here''s my big question. You said you''re still feeling the effects. Are you starting to pick up now? A little bit. I''d like to see more, but I''m still kind of leery what the future is going to bring. Yeah, truth be told, I''ve been kind of hearing that a lot. The whole tariff thing going on. Everybody is kind of getting nervous. But I will say that, not to put any pressure on you or anything like that, but I will say that especially if you are starting to feel an uptick a little bit, I''m not saying make any major decisions right now. I''m saying let us know and start taking a look again. You want to start that process before A, you get too busy and you can''t. Because let''s be fair, that''s generally what happens when I talk to people. They''re like, ah, we''re slow. Okay, that''s cool. I get it. But then what happens when I call them back in like six months and now we''re too busy. Which is a good problem to have, but at the same time, especially with, to your point, there''s a lot of uncertainty going on. So whether it''s us or somebody else, I would imagine having something at some point would help kind of ease that uncertainty, right? The more visibility you have, the less uncertainty there is, truth be told. I mean, we''re not hurting. Our system that we got now works just fine. What are you using now? I''m using Lotus 1-2-3. I know it''s old and outdated. You''re throwing that at me before I even said anything. Right? Yeah, that''s like a, I mean, that''s almost, that''s not on DOS, is it? It''s when it works on Windows. It''s getting to be, my IT guy says it''s getting to be harder and harder to install on these newer computers. All the more reason why, and like I said, and it''s not about choosing us. It''s just about positioning yourself to know what''s out there for the inevitable. Because I know that, because if I''m not mistaken, Lotus 1-2-3, that''s almost just like an old spreadsheet format, right? Yep, yep. It''s an old spreadsheet software, and the former owner that I took over for, he did all the programming and everything to get it to work, and it has its quirks, but it works. It works for what we need. So like I said, I''m not hurting. At some point, I''d like to upgrade if I could and try to get to something a little more up-to-date and more user-friendly. Sometimes this software can be a little not so user-friendly. Right. So let me ask you this. What about getting yourself in a position of, like you said, I get that you''re saying that you''re not quite ready and what you have is kind of working now, but you are wanting to eventually get to the point of at least investigation of seeing what''s out there and what''s going to be right for you. When does it make sense to do that? Because I wouldn''t... I don''t want you to get too busy when things start picking up. Like I said, I know what generally happens, right? We''re going to wait a few months, things will probably pick up, and then I''ll end up calling you back and you''re like, ah, now I''m too busy. And I don''t want that to happen. Right. To be honest with you, like I said, with the uncertainty, I''m not sure when a good time is to kind of do the investigation process. I had started that before things had gone for the worst. I want to make sure that I get the best system that works for me for what we do. Well, if things are kind of slow now, why not just start the process now? Without trying to be sound pushy, but truth be told, if things are kind of slow right now, like I said, it''s not about signing a line, but why not just start the process? Because I don''t even think we ever got to a point of giving you any kind of numbers or pricing or anything like that. I don''t even think we ever got to a demo, truth be told. I''m kind of familiar with Job Boss Squared. You guys bought out E2, I do believe. Yeah, yeah. I had some experience a long time ago with E2 at one of my former jobs. Okay, did they use E2 Pro or E2 Shop? I think it was E2 Shop. Okay, good deal. Yeah, but like I said, it''s been a long, long time since that was back in the late 2000s. I''m sure it''s all new now. If you did use E2 Shop, there''s probably going to be a lot of the ebbs and flow, the workflow of it, everything like that is going to look familiar, but there have been a lot of improvements for sure. I was an old E2 guy. I used to work for E2 myself. So I''ve seen a lot of those changes kind of come and go. I actually used to support, be in support when I was over in E2. So trust me when I say there''s been not too many changes where I think you would be afraid, but enough changes where it probably warrants doing a demo at some point, right? To kind of see that. So, I mean, what do you say? What about I send you some times to get in touch with Nick maybe next week and at least have that initial conversation with him? And if it makes sense at the end of that to go further, fine. And if it doesn''t, you just don''t talk to us anymore, I guess. All right. That''s fine. I mean, do you have some time maybe next week? Yeah. I''m here Monday through Friday, 7 to 3.30. So anytime that works for you guys, I''m here. Yeah. And like I said, I''m not going to do anything wild like jump you to a demo or anything, but like I said, I definitely think it makes at least a little bit of sense to have a short conversation about it. Right. Let me see. Sorry, I''m looking at. You''re here Monday through Friday, you said? Yep. How about we aim for Monday? Okay. Well, yeah, let me see what he''s got on Monday. What time zone are you in? You''re in Central, right? I''m correct about that? Okay, that''s what I thought. Let''s aim for 11 a.m. Okay. Your time. Central. All right. Okay. Let me see here. Is it still Jay Hemmingson at Toolform? Yep. Okay. I''m going to put you on his calendar. I''ll have him give you a call. And like I said, at the end of the call, you decide, nah, I don''t really want to go any further than that. And you just let us know when you''re ready. Or maybe at the end of it, you say, Maybe we should look at a demo. But like I said, no pressure. Fair enough? I''ll send you an invite for Monday and then we''ll go from there, okay? Sounds good. All right. It''s good talking to you, Jeremy. Yep. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
This conversation is between Adam from Job Boss Squared and Jeremy from Toolform. Adam reaches out to reconnect after a year to discuss potential upgrades to Jeremy''s outdated software system. Jeremy expresses hesitancy due to current uncertainties but agrees to an initial meeting to explore options.

**Key Points:**  
• **Current Business Challenges:** Jeremy mentions that Toolform is still recovering from a slow period last year and is cautious about making changes due to uncertainty in the market.  

• **Outdated Software System:** Jeremy is using Lotus 1-2-3, an old spreadsheet software, which is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. While it works for now, he acknowledges the need for an upgrade in the future.  

• **Next Steps Agreed:** Adam suggests starting the process of exploring new systems now, given the slower business period. Jeremy agrees to a preliminary call with Nick from Job Boss Squared on Monday at 11 a.m. Central Time to discuss options further.', NULL, '{"overallScore":85,"criteria":{"talkTimeRatio":70,"objectionHandling":8,"discoveryQuestions":5,"valueArticulation":9,"activeListening":9,"nextSteps":true,"rapport":8},"strengths":["Effective objection handling","Clear articulation of value proposition","Strong rapport-building"],"improvements":["Reduce talk time to allow more client input","Focus on deeper discovery questions","Streamline scheduling process"],"actionItems":["Prepare tailored demo materials for Jeremy based on his current system and needs","Follow up with Jeremy after the scheduled call to confirm next steps","Research potential challenges transitioning from Lotus 1-2-3 to Job Boss Squared"],"summary":"The sales call demonstrated strong rapport-building and effective objection handling, leading to a scheduled follow-up meeting.

Hey Sabrina, it''s Tim over at Bolt Software. Hey Tim. How are you doing? I''m doing okay. All right, all right, gonna make it. It''s the weekend and it''s a long one, so I''ll take it. My wife and I are going on vacation, celebrating our anniversary and her birthday. Well, congratulations both directions. Yeah, we are in the final hours. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, I hope that I don''t take up too much of your time. So I''m really walking into this blind. I don''t really know how to start this, so I''ll let you go and then I''ll give you the information that you need. Yeah, for sure. I do this every day, all day, so I''m happy to guide you through this process, no problem. I am curious, how did you hear about us? Well, so the owner of the company has a friend that apparently uses you guys. I don''t know which friend this is. I don''t know what business that it''s really for. So he told me about it the other day, sent me a link, and I was just kind of going over it. And I''m like, look, I don''t know if it''ll work for us, but it''s worth a phone call. It''s worth asking questions, giving them information, and seeing where we land with this. So that''s where we are. Love it. Sounds good. So the way that I find it best is I can give you a 30,000-foot flyover of who we work with and what we do. And then I''ll kind of just ask some questions about your business. And at the end of this, the whole idea is just to see if it makes sense to progress to a demo, or I''ll tell you, hey, this system is not built for you guys. I don''t think it''s worth your time. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that''s perfect. Cool. So just at a very high level, we are a software product built specifically for trade contractors that work with production home builders or custom home builders to a degree. But from the ground up, we are designed to centralize the PO management process. If you''re working out of builder portals like BuildPro, SupplyPro, BuilderTrend, ITK, stuff like that, and try to bring all of that into one place to make it easy to track all the details to every project, such as scheduling, such as documents, photos, time tracking, contracts that you agree with the builder on, things of that nature. And then we provide your team with a mobile app so that everybody''s aligned in real time. They can take photos in the field, send pictures back to the office, and then you have the way of tracking billing and getting that information into an accounting system so that everything just syncs up and it''s just one unified single source of truth. Okay. Big things that we typically help with are companies who are really struggling to just stay on top of the schedules because things change so consistently in this line of work. They just need an easier way to make those changes and ensure they don''t waste trips to job sites, make sure that it''s easy to track changes in the field. If the builder needs additional work that wasn''t originally a part of the plan, just making sure that gets communicated in real time, and just making sure you''re not entering the same information across multiple systems or putting on a whiteboard that gets erased, things like that. Okay. Does that help a little bit? Yeah, and so let me tell you, I mean, and I kind of gathered that because I was, you know, obviously I was Googling and all the wonderful things, resources, just reading the testimonies from your clients. I don''t know specifically that this is really geared toward us, so let me tell you about us. We are a small lawn and landscape company. We do yard maintenance for customers. We aren''t necessarily in line with building, quote unquote. We will go do landscaping after something is built, but as far as the actual construction, we''re not in that line at all. And we work out of QuickBooks, and we''re such a small company that we literally have an admin staff of three, and we use QuickBooks. I''ve been with the company almost two years, not quite. We don''t even use a PO system here. We don''t use POs through QuickBooks, even though I would love to have a procurement process, for the work that happens, it just doesn''t work. We hire a lot of the H-2A workers to do our lawn and landscape work for us. So we have a bit of a, I''m trying to be professional and get my words right here. So we do use a whiteboard for, you know, we have a customer that wants a landscape, that''s what goes on our board, or sod or something like that. Our guys aren''t very technical. There''s language barriers. There''s, what am I trying to say? We write in English, they like to write in Spanish. And so there''s that, you know, that as well. So given that, do you still see that this is something that would be geared toward us? Yes, mostly. There''s still a couple things I want to clarify before we continue like fully. But it''s like this is, so just so you know, you can say and speak your language however you like. I have been in construction since birth. When I was born, my dad had a framing business that he was running. He''s a home builder now, but he has been, I''ve been in and around this industry my entire life. I owned my own construction cleaning business for seven years. So however you say things is totally fine with me. I will understand, and if I don''t understand, I''ll ask. But I''ve also worked with a lot of landscaping companies. And a lot of the things that you just said are pretty much ring true for every landscaping company I''ve talked to. So the language barrier, not a problem. We built this system here in Texas. It was built by an electrician, and he had the exact same concern when he started building software for his company. It''s like, how the heck is this going to work? Our app is Spanish friendly, so it translates the information for your Spanish groups to make it easier for you guys to communicate. Okay, and so if the guys are in the field and they''re, okay, so I guess I should let you just keep going because right now I guess I don''t completely, you know, obviously I don''t understand how the whole thing works. So yeah, you go ahead. Yeah, and we''ll get to the demo and walk you through how the product works and everything. But who are some of your customers? Well, our customers are just residential for the most part. We have, we do the McDonald''s landscaping in the Southeast Texas area. We handle Smurfett Westrock, their Evadale facility. We do their lawn maintenance and their janitorial services. That, however, might, might would be a different animal within itself, the janitorial, because it''s ran through the customer''s software, which is track. So there''s things that have to be done in there. I don''t really know how that would feed into this. That could actually be part of a different conversation, I guess. But as far as commercial, it''s really just the McDonald''s that we do at this point. We don''t have a lot of commercial activity. We are 98% residential. Okay, and the residential side, are you installing new landscape and sod? Are you doing irrigation? Or are you purely just, hey, like I own my home. I have somebody that comes on a biweekly basis and mows my yard and takes care. And then once a season, they do the remulch. They put flowers down, stuff like that. We do every bit of the above. Okay, so you do new installations. We do new installations. We do, we clean up existing. We do new irrigation, or we will go repair, replace parts on older or, you know, irrigation systems that we didn''t do. So what percentage, so for those new installations, are those still, are those all directly with the homeowners? Are those with like home builders? Nope, homeowners. Okay, what percentage would you say is new install versus service work? Gosh, we have so many repeat customers until I would venture to say probably 65 to 70%, 75%. And it may be a little bit higher. It just, it varies so much from year to year. But would be our repeat customers and then everyone else. That''s not ours. That''s y''all''s. It''s going to be new. Okay, and then how many customers do you guys currently have? Currently, we probably have 115, 120. He said you''re managing the scheduling aspect all on a whiteboard? Yes, it''s literally the scheduling, it''s very basic because it can''t be complicated, right? I''m going to do a landscape job for you, I''m coming on this day. That''s really the part of it. So yeah, we do it on a whiteboard. It''s split into two parts, the top month, the bottom month, and we write the days on it, and these are the days we''re going to be there. Yeah, and how are you communicating that to the crews? The crews get work orders, they get punch lists, and then we talk about it with them as well, but they actually have the physical copies. Y''all have like a morning meeting where you''re like, okay, you guys are going to these jobs, here''s your paperwork? So here''s the process, and these are, let me just say, this is the process. So the owner and his son are the two that really drive the crews. And so the owner, his son, and our estimating scheduler, they meet in the morning, and our nursery manager, they will meet in the mornings to go over previous day''s work, current day work, and then the owner and his son are the ones that are actually communicating with the guys and dictating to them when, where, why, how. Okay. They''re the ones making changes, you know, so it''s really those two that are directing the traffic. Gotcha. And another question I have, are you guys, are y''all picking up your materials, your sod, things like that from a yard, or do y''all basically have it all in-house and have your own managing? No, we get that from turf farms. Okay, cool. So what do you think, did he mention why he thought it would be a good idea to explore this system? Anything specific on that front? Yes, and I''m going to be blatantly honest. So in the office of a staff of literally three, I''m the office manager, I do billing, AP, payroll, Kevin''s personal assistant, everything. And then I have a lady that does all the estimating and scheduling, and then we''ve got Kevin and Kyler. So there''s frustrations, you know, if we put a schedule together, but we don''t follow the process to follow that schedule, and changes are made, but that is not communicated across the board, then obviously there''s frustrations that take place, right? So that''s ultimately, in a nutshell, that''s why I''m talking to you, because that seems to happen, and he gets frustrated, and then he talks to his friends, you know, well, this is great, this works, and I''m going, well, they''re also running, you know, $80 million, we''re running six. And I''m not beating us down at all, that''s great for our industry in this area. Oh, yeah. But it''s really, we have the paper, do we need the paper, would it be easier if nobody had paper, if everybody was working off of a, you know, electronically, well, I don''t know the answer to that, you know, I think there''s limitations with our team to a degree, but is it trainable? Probably. Yeah, and I''ll let you know now, if you guys do decide to partner up with us, and it seems like something that would work for you, we''ll take care of the training aspect. We have that built in on our side. We have an entire team dedicated to ensuring that you get set up properly. So walk me through more of these frustrations. Why are they occurring exactly? Well, a lot of our business, like I said, they''re repeat customers, and so a lot of our customers have, you know, Kevin on speed dial, or they have his phone number, or certain things come up, and so they''ll call Kevin, and they''ll want this done, and he''s moving things around, and he''s busy, and maybe he forgets to tell us, or the information doesn''t come across correctly, and, you know, myself and the estimator and scheduler, Ms. Laura, we''re only as good as the information we''re given. So let me give you a little bit of how the process, once they''re on the board, well, just bear with me one second. So a customer calls, and we put the meeting on Kevin''s calendar. He''s the one that actually goes out and meets with the customer. He takes a piece of graph paper with him, and he writes notes in his own way, and he''ll do a very rough sketch of what the conversation is about, how they''re wanting things to look, and, you know, the list of things that they''re wanting, whether it''s stone or mulch or whatever, whatever, whatever, and he brings that back to the office. Now, from that piece of graph paper with his scratch on and his rough sketch, we, my estimator and scheduler, Miss Laura, has to decipher what he''s saying. So we take that, break it down, and build the estimate into QuickBooks off of this piece of graph paper. Now, we created a nice form. You know, we had an operations manager that came on board, created a nice form, asked him to use it. It was rejected right up front. Was not using it, and he still never did. So that is how the process starts. So that in itself is a lot of frustration. When he is seeing four to five people a day, and he''s 30 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and it''s very rough. It takes a lot of time to figure out what he''s trying to tell us sometimes. And a lot of times it''s not complete. You know, we''re constantly having to ask him questions. Well, what is this? And if you want this, then where''s it at on the drawing? And you know what I mean? It''s just a lot of back and forth. That in itself is probably the biggest thorn with the upfront process, getting it from the paper into the system. And then, you know, once it goes to the customer, once it''s an estimate, it goes to the customer, then it''s volleying back and forth with them. Well, I don''t like this. I want to change this. I want to add this, yada, yada, whatever. And then among that, we have to make sure that all these changes that the customer is making is getting into their file, into QuickBooks, and to the guys. You know, because we don''t want to leave anything out, obviously. So herein lies the frustration. You know, something''s getting missed because somebody''s not telling us something, or, you know, we''re not deciphering correctly, or this was forgotten on the list, or, you know, you didn''t understand them correctly. They asked for this, but they didn''t know what they were asking for, that whole thing. Who''s managing those changes? Is that also Kevin, or is that whoever''s building the estimate? At what point? Well, you said that, so Kevin goes out there, does the chicken scratch doctor''s handwriting to pull it together with the customers trying to, like, communicate. He then brings that back to you guys in the office. Somebody creates an estimate out of that information in QuickBooks, and then the estimate goes back to the customer, right? Correct. And then the customer is going to make changes because they don''t know what they''re asking for. They have no clue what the heck landscaping even means. So then things are just getting moved around. Is that, who''s the changes in that process being communicated to? Is that going to Kevin back to you guys again, or is that going directly to the estimator? That''s going, it''s ultimately, I mean, oh my gosh, initially it''s going to the estimator, Ms. Laura, my clerk that puts them together. However, we typically have to run them by Kevin just to make sure that it will work. You know, they may have a small spot and they want, you know, an oak tree, but they don''t realize that that oak tree gets 50 foot tall. You know what I mean? So it goes to Laura first. If it''s something, you know, because we do it so much, a lot of times she can say, oh, well, that will work. Ultimately, it''s your house. You can do what you want. But, you know, let me run it by Kevin to make sure that it''s going to work there or see if there''s an alternative to that for you. So between Laura and Kevin, it really bounces back and forth until the customer says, okay, I approve that. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I really appreciate you just painting the picture for me and telling me how this process gets communicated because every time I talk to a landscaper, this is one of the more chaotic processes within their business is how this all unfolds. Yeah, it''s crazy. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so the estimate gets done and you and the customer agree that this is the plan. What are the next steps from there? Okay, so once we agree that they pay their deposit and we schedule them on our board, our calendar, and they are notified, hey, we''re coming out in two weeks. You know, we''re going to be there in the morning or the afternoon. And so we get to that point the day before we print or the week of, we print all the work orders for the guys. We put them in their boxes so that they can familiarize themselves with, you know, what''s going on. In between that, you know, someone''s pulling the plants. You know, there''s things, once the estimate is approved, we make sure we have those plants on site in the nursery or that they''ve been ordered so that, you know, everything''s ready for the job. And then the week of, the work orders are printed and they''re given to the guys. And then we walk through the rest of that process. And then after the job''s completed, then you bill the rest of the remaining amount? That is correct. Once the job is completed, the guys have a foreman''s report that they fill out that because just because we bid 15 yards of mulch doesn''t mean we''re going to use that much. So the foreman''s report is the actual finalized number for the product or material being used. And once they bring that foreman''s report in after the job is completed, then Laura, if need be, will modify those quantities and then she will send the final invoice. And that''s all done through QuickBooks? Correct. Cool. Okay. And then are there ever changes that come up whenever your guys go out to the, are on the job? Every single day. Every day. Every day. How are those being communicated and tracked? So most of the time they''re on site, customer walks out, hey, can you add or can you do, they''ll call into the office to Laura and say, hey, she''s wanting to add or she''s wanting to do. And so, you know, Laura''s making note of that. In the meantime, we''ve got somebody coming back to the yard to pick up whatever it is that they''re wanting to add and take it to the site so that it can be done at that time. Do they ever not call Laura and they just do it? Yes. Yes. If it''s, you know, if they''ve taken, well, not even if they''ve taken extra, there are times when the customer will ask for something and, you know, Kyler, you know, will come back, grab it and take it. And then after the fact, you know, it''s on the foreman''s report and she''s like, well, what is this? It wasn''t on the estimate. Well, they wanted it, you know, when we got there or she said this before we left. Yeah, that happens a lot. Does it ever not make it on the foreman''s report? Yes. Yeah. Yes. All right. Yes. And I think it''s probably just in, you know, everybody''s trying to do what, you know, what we''ve got laid out and it''s just in the middle of it and they just, you know, forget to write it down or, you know, it''s just not accounted for or whatever, but it''s not often, but it does happen. Anything else going on just in the general process? No, I mean, that''s because once it gets to the point of the final invoice being sent to the customer, then it''s, you know, then it''s just accounts receivable collecting on that invoice. And then the process just starts over, you know. Now, once the one thing that we do that I request just from a financial perspective and the way QuickBooks handles things is if we create an estimate and the customer approves that estimate and we collect the deposit on that estimate, then if they call a couple of days later and say, oh, well, I want to add such and such or I want you to give me a quote on such and such, then I have Laura go in and create a whole new estimate because we''ve already applied a payment to that specific transaction because the way QuickBooks works is once it''s been approved and accepted, then it has to be converted to an actual invoice. So once it becomes an actual invoice, then it starts hitting my financials. And so if I apply a payment to it, but then you go in and you start adding to it, then things are wonky. So we do have, you know, those instances where we''ve already started this estimate. Oh, well, now I want to add this, but we just do it as a completely new estimate just to keep the books clean. Other than those pieces, it''s really, really that. That is the hiccup in the whole process. To me, it''s not even the whiteboard. You know, it''s not that. It''s communication for number one. And then, you know, well, I guess communication is really it across the board because if anything is changed and it''s not communicated to Laura, then she doesn''t know to revise it. If the guys do something in the field and doesn''t tell Laura or Kyler or myself, then again, here we are, you know, chase and tell. Well, what I can tell you is that landscapers pretty much across the board all have a service component to their business. Whether they work with production builders or not, service is always going to be a big part of landscaping more so than pretty much any other trade I work with just because it''s really, really easy to like basically put, install landscapes and then build a relationship with the customer and retain that business as a regular business, right? Right, right. And we, the landscapers I''ve worked with have been very successful using our system for the things that you''re describing, especially when it comes to communication breakdowns because whenever you change something in the system, it changes on a global scale. So if Kevin needs to reschedule a job in the field from the mobile app, that''s going to automatically update on your schedules in the office. But we can also, again, pictures and documentation. We can put these forms that you guys are using to build your estimates. We can template that out in our system so that Kevin can just draw on a PDF in our app, make the notes, check off boxes, send that to you guys. We even have talk to text, which I think is what we would push him to use. He would not, I can tell you. He won''t do it. He won''t click a button and just talk to the phone rather than typing. No, I''m sure he will not. Hey, you know what? There''s a first time for everything, and he may prove me 100% wrong. Well, I find it interesting that he would push you to take a look at a software system, but he''s not willing to use the software. Yeah, no, I completely agree. Yeah, I mean, we brought an operations manager on board to identify efficiencies or inefficiencies, and he ain''t here no more. And I''m just being, I mean, I am very black and white. There''s no gray area, you know, so I''m not about to waste your time or anything. So I want you to know what it is. I would love to know who he talked to who pushed him toward this, because that would help me a lot in just being like, I mean, I can tell you, whoever you talk to is using the system this way, and they''re successful because of it. And I will definitely try to find out. But you know what? Let''s say for the sake of argument that he says, okay, I''ll do that. I''ll use talk to text. I use talk to text every single day of my life, and it''s great. It saves me a lot of keystrokes. Saves me a lot of time. We have this really cool ability. So in the mobile app, you can have documents, right? And you can edit these documents. And there''s a specific thing you can do where you can actually, on that document, you can record a voice note, right? So if he''s drawing and doing his little things with his pencil on his iPad, he could record a voice note rather than like jotting all of this down, like freehand. And then you guys in the office would just have to listen to his voice rather than try to read what he''s trying to put down. Yeah, almost like dictation. Absolutely. That would be great. Yeah. And I feel like he''s got to be able to do that for you guys more so than for himself. So let me ask you this. Okay, so say we do this, and I know that you''ve said that the translation, and this is a big thing on my mind because all of our guys, we have a couple that can speak decent English, but they don''t always understand English so well. So if they''re in the field and they do a note and they do it, you know, speaking the note, and that comes across, we''re able to hear that in English? That translation works like that? No, I''m really hoping that we get to a point where like this new AI kick will allow us to start incorporating stuff like that because it''s pretty close. There''s some cool stuff happening with artificial intelligence. But right now we haven''t incorporated that or it''s not there yet from a technological standpoint. When it comes to like translation is one, there''s a couple different ways to look at this. One, we can have it to where all the hard-coded fields in our app translate to Spanish so that it''s easy for them to navigate. And then on the flip side, we''re also putting a lot of like we''re templating out a lot of things so that your guys don''t have to put in as many notes. They just have to click buttons, right? So when we build out forms or whatnot, it''s less of them having to jot notes down and more of them just saying, yes, I did this. No, this wasn''t there. So like a drop-down box. Exactly. And that''s something we put into Spanish so that it''s... Okay, so it''s put in Spanish. Okay, okay. I was going to say, okay, so if they check this box, I used four blue plumbagos and 16 foxtail ferns, and they put that in English because their numbers, it''s crazy. It''s not always in English. So as long as when we get it in the office, we''re able to see it in English and it''s correct, then that would be great. Yeah, because we have about 65 companies in Texas alone and then companies through New Mexico, Arizona, California, and we have no issue with the Spanish-English communication. Okay, that''s awesome. Awesome. Okay, that''s good. Any other questions? So this... Product communicates with QuickBooks. So how would that work? So would we still maintain QuickBooks for billing and all of that? Or is this a replacement of QuickBooks? No, it''s not a replacement. We are not an accounting system. We do everything from the start of a project to up into billing, right? So we can create invoice drafts out of Bolt. You can manage your contracts and your items, like how much we''re going to charge for this. You can basically, for your situation, build an estimate in our system. And then when it comes time to bill on that final estimate, you could push the information from Bolt to QuickBooks so you''re not doing duplicate data entry. Okay, so... Because right now there''s a lot of manual data entry on how you are doing things today. Yes, because the company''s never been... It is in my short-term goal to get us to a P2P process. But right now it''s far from there. Number one, I don''t have the staff. And number two, change is hard. And pushing anything, I''ve got to have my ducks in a row when I approach it. We do... Yeah, so anyway. Okay, so the estimate... Go ahead. I think there are some really complex features in our system that we can get to in time. But what I would probably recommend is we start really basic and solve this communication piece and see if we can just make it easy for you, Kevin, and everybody else to get on the same page. Yes, yeah. And if we can accomplish that, I think that''s a massive benefit to the company. All the other stuff, we can address in implementation as you guys get more comfortable with the system itself. Okay, so let me back up for just a second so I understand. So the estimate process, Kevin has his tablet or whatever. Is it a tablet or is it just his phone? It could be a tablet or a phone. I would probably recommend a tablet for the fact that he''s drawing. Just give him more real estate to work with. But if he has a phone, we can make that work. Okay, so he has his device. He goes to the customer. So we put the customer database into... Or is he actually signing on to Bolt, which is tied to QuickBooks and our customer information is feeding across from there? Or how does the customer information get... Let me back up. My brain is getting ahead of my mouth. No, you''re good. I know where you''re going, and I can explain it to you, but it''s going to be a lot easier to look at it from a visual perspective. Okay. And I think I''m confident that we can help you guys out based on everything you told me, your process, the challenges within your process. I think it would be best to schedule out a demo. Okay. My teammate Chrissy is our product expert. She demos Bolt. My job is just to make sure all your questions get answered and kind of just manage this process that we''re in. But the next step from here would be to schedule out that demo so you can take a look at it. I would probably say just keep it to you for now. Okay. If you like what you see, you think it''s something that could work for the team, let''s schedule out a second demo with the rest of the team once you''re confident. Okay, yeah. What do you think? Yeah, that sounds great. I think there''d be mass confusion if we did it any other way. Cool. And then you can also, like, if you like it, you can also guide us and be like, okay, let''s maybe not get too deep on this process. Let''s focus more on this thing when we talk with Kevin, stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Cool. So I am out of town next week for that vacation. Would you be okay scheduling something for, like, the first week of June? Yeah, that''s perfectly fine. Next week is actually month end for me, so not just month end, quarter end, month end. So I''ll be kind of busy next week anyway. Okay. What day would work best for you that week? Let me see. Hang on one second. Okay. I''ll tell you what, because that first week of June is a payroll week for me, can we do it the week of the 9th? Like that Tuesday the 10th would be okay. Okay. I''m going to make a note to give you a shout that Monday just to make sure nothing has come up crazy. Okay. But let''s go ahead and put something tentative on for that Tuesday. What time specifically would work best for you? If we could do around two, the afternoons seem to be a little bit better for me than the mornings. Chrissy, you have a dentist appointment at 2.30? Can we do one o''clock? Yeah, one will be fine. One will be great. All right. I will get that demo sent out, and then I''ll get Chrissy notes from this conversation so that she''s fully prepped up to address a lot of what we talked about, and we''ll just kind of go from there. Okay, awesome. Tim, thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing what you guys got. Yeah, I appreciate all the information. I love how you walked me through your company and just all the details of it. It''s awesome. Yeah, and that''s just high level. Wait till you really see it. You guys are an incredibly complex organization, but I work with landscapers all the time. Okay, well, that''s great to know. I''ll be honest. You are my second favorite trade to work with. Oh, wow. Okay, awesome. Plumbing is my favorite. Really? Yeah. Wow. It''s the most complex trade type out there, and just every single business is so incredibly different for the exact same kind of trade, but I''ve worked with more plumbing companies than I''ve worked with any trade at this point. Landscapers are definitely up there as well, though. Oh, gosh. Wow. Okay, well, I look forward to it, and I really thank you for your time and your knowledge and expertise and listening. For sure. Yeah, no, I mean, that''s the only way this thing works, right? Right, right. There''s a lot of BS software out there, and we''re just trying to make sure that we don''t rope anybody around. Right. Well, let me ask you just a ballpark high-level question. Go in the direction that we were talking, just getting us to where the mass confusion is less confusion. Ballpark average, what does this run roughly? How many total employees do you have? That would be using the program or company-wide? We''ll probably have a better idea of who''s going to use the program once we get to the demo. You''ll have a much better idea of who needs to have access to it, but how many people in office do you guys have? Altogether, we probably have about 40. 40 total employees? Yeah. And then do you subcontract any work? It''s kind of seasonal, so in the wintertime we may have less, because again, all of our lawn and landscape, I don''t want to say all, but 22 of them are H-2A visa workers, so they all go home in November. So, yeah, but during peak season, you know, February to October, November, we''re running about 40. Okay. I''d say we''d probably be in the ballpark of $1,000 to $1,500 a month with that user count. It could be more, it could be less. Again, you''ll have a much better idea of how many people need to have access to the system once you get an idea of how everything functions, but my recommendation is you definitely want everybody in the office to have access to the system. Any field supervisors, Kevin for sure, and then typically your crew leads will have access so that you have somebody that''s able to clock crews in, take pictures, stuff like that. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that''s still going to be a pretty good number, but yeah, we can definitely look at that. I mean, obviously later, but that''s a good ballpark to have, because he''ll ask, you know, so I can at least say roughly, you know, given certain dynamics or whatever, this is apt to change. Yeah, and just so you know, all of our pricing is based on users. There''s a flat fee for the software system, and then there''s a user fee, and then we do have an implementation and training fee, and there''s three different packages you guys can choose from on that front. Oh, okay, okay. Okay, well, perfect, perfect. All right, well, I look forward to the demo. Awesome. I''m looking forward to just seeing if we can help you guys out and everything. Awesome. All right, Tim, well, you enjoy your vacation and the holiday, and congratulations to you and your wife. I appreciate it. Enjoy your long weekend, all right? You too. All right, bye-bye. Thanks.

Hello.

Could you repeat that, please? I''m having a hard time. I''m not sure about my connection.

My name is Reginald. Hi, Reginald. Hey, Susan. How are you doing? All right, perfect. Okay, let''s get started here. If you can head to our fastsupport.gotoassist.com. Let''s see. So it''s file support. It''s fast, F-A-S-T, support. Fast support. Yep. Go to assist.com. That''s the longest website you''ll type in today here. Fastsupport.gotoassist. All right.

Okay, I can see your screen. Let''s take a look at what you are seeing. So I see your McCullough icon at the very bottom there. Yeah, that''s the local. And then on the Internet Explorer is the browser. Okay, so let''s see here. Let''s take a look. So when you log in in the morning, you log into your Windows environment, and then... Yeah, so the first Internet Explorer option there. Yeah, there you go. Okay, so this is how you would begin to log in, and this is where it''s failing for you? Yeah, usually we don''t get this. So if I can close this window. Let''s see. Nope, come on. Usually we''ll come in, open up Internet Explorer. We have the shortcut up here. Click on that, and it opens. So today everybody''s getting the sign-in requirement. Okay, let me take a screenshot of this screen. It looks like a Windows security prompt. Okay, so then if you try to put in... So you''ve never had to do this before, right? You click on the link, it used to go straight to McCullough. Reginald, if you can hold on for one second, the IT guy is calling in on my other phone. Okay, sounds good. Hey, Justin. Somebody here? Okay, I got McCullough''s on the line now. So should I tell him that... Okay, all right. I''m going to put you on... You want me to put you on hold or... Okay. Hello. Hey, Reginald, I don''t know if you could hear part of that conversation, but the IT guy is saying that there''s someone on site here has plugged in a Netgear appliance, and it''s conflicting with the domain server. So that''s... He believes it''s what''s causing this authentication issue, but he said it''s not a McCullough issue, it''s... Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, this doesn''t feel McCullough-y. It feels kind of more network server related. Is there... The number that you called me, is that something where I can call you back if we''re not able to resolve it? It''s best to just shoot me an email if you can. I sent you an email through that case ID, and that''ll go to my personal inbox, and that''ll light up. So if you respond to that saying, hey, Reg, we''re all set. Let me just make sure I got it in here. Okay, at the support. Yeah, yep, we''ll take care of you there if you respond. So let me know. Yeah, keep me posted. I figured that was the route it was going to go. It''s before it gets to the actual application. It sounds network-y or server related. Okay, well, thanks for getting right on that. We appreciate it. No problem. Thank you, and have a good one. Thanks, bye. Thanks, bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
The conversation involves troubleshooting a technical issue where a user, Susan, is unable to log into a system (McCullough) due to an unexpected Windows security prompt. Reginald, the support technician, guides Susan through the process of sharing her screen and diagnosing the issue. The root cause is identified as a network conflict caused by a Netgear appliance, as confirmed by an on-site IT technician.

**Key Points:**  
• **Screen Sharing Setup:** Reginald instructs Susan to visit a support website and enter a session key to establish a remote connection for troubleshooting.  

• **Issue Diagnosis:** The issue is identified as a Windows security prompt appearing during login, which is unusual for the system. Reginald suspects the problem is network-related rather than application-specific.  

• **Root Cause and Next Steps:** An on-site IT technician confirms the issue is caused by a Netgear appliance conflicting with the domain server. Reginald advises Susan to email him for follow-up updates and resolution confirmation.

Hey, Reginald. This is Ben. Hello, Hank.

Hey, Ben. How are you doing?

I''m pretty good. How about yourself?

Doing well. Doing well here. And how can we help?

So last week, my call of software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC, I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem. But I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized. And the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose Maximize from the taskbar. And it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client. And that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates, about that time. That may be a coincidence, but... Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of, yeah, kind of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben, just in case, I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your, let''s see, what company are you working with again? The company, I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the manager MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO, okay. Let me try to find, and you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients or their tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me, let''s see. So Clarksville is the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay. So you do have me there from a previous support. Perfect. Okay. Now I need to get this case created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay. So yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9 dot, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9 dot 310 or 310. 310. Okay. All right. Sounds good. So it sounds like Windows update issue caused window issues. So. Yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah. I''m leaning there with you. Typically there''s a couple of, I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots. I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression is a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything? Like not opening? Well, we had a problem. Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar. And so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but yeah, the search functionally. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server... Okay, the workstation he''s on, let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11, okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I guess, I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. It''s a little bit behind, but that''s okay. Although I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, or platform requirements. Okay. Okay, and then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details, but it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? That documentation is pretty straightforward. So is it just a client upgrade, or do we need to upgrade the server database, or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported, operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review? I see that you called in the past support articles. Let me... I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start the case there, but I don''t remember creating a case or an account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need... Yeah, let me just make sure. Ben.illiam at twinoakstech.com. That''s your... That''s correct. Yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, just shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t? Okay. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might find out. Okay. Looks like you submitted cases in the past, so I think you do have access. You should be good. Let me see if I can just... Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah, just go and do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay, I got the portal. You see your request or you see your password? Nice, nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. I''ll put it in our password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right, I''m going to send you an email right now with all this good info. Okay. Yep, I''m in the customer portal now, so I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information. If you need anything else, create a case, reach out, and we''ll take care of you. But thanks for giving us some time today. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one. Bye. You too. Bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Ben contacted senior support to address a software compatibility issue affecting the Clarksville Economic Development Council''s McCullough Progression software after recent Windows updates. Reginald identified the problem as a compatibility issue between the software version and Windows 11, provided troubleshooting guidance, and shared relevant documentation to assist with resolving the issue.

**Key Points:**  
• **Issue Description:** Ben reported that the McCullough Progression software minimizes unexpectedly and has lookup function issues after recent Windows updates. The problem occurs on both workstations running Windows 11 and a server running Windows Server 2016.  

• **Root Cause Identified:** Reginald confirmed that the software version (7.9.310) is not supported on Windows 11, which likely caused the compatibility issues. He recommended reviewing platform requirements and upgrading the software to a supported version.  

• **Resolution Steps:** Reginald promised to send documentation, including platform requirements and troubleshooting articles, and verified Ben''s access to the customer portal for further resources. Ben successfully logged into the portal to review the materials.', NULL, '{"overallScore":78,"criteria":{"talkTimeRatio":65,"objectionHandling":8,"discoveryQuestions":12,"valueArticulation":7,"activeListening":9,"nextSteps":true,"rapport":8},"strengths":["Effective active listening and clarification","Thorough discovery process to identify issues","Clear articulation of next steps and resources"],"improvements":["Reduce talk time ratio to allow more client input","Improve efficiency in identifying compatibility issues","Enhance articulation of upgrade benefits"],"actionItems":["Follow up with the client to ensure compatibility issues are resolved","Provide a detailed guide for upgrading software and server platforms","Confirm client access to the customer portal and support articles"],"summary":"The sales call demonstrated strong active listening and rapport-building skills, with a thorough discovery process to identify the client''s technical issues.

Hey, Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about JobBoss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? JobBoss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, JobBoss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do coating for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with JobBoss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. So. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where are we gonna go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s gonna get, it''s gonna grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, a deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like, I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. So as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, it comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know, like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of material, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. Yeah. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have in the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Jobshop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location in- Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs and I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might''ve been the name that he said. So very possible. Well, let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. I''ll just type in as we were talking too so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay, well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay, thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay, you too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Meeting Summary: Discussion on JobBoss Squared**

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I actually was looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, no, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you go ahead. Where were you going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s why I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know when someone uploads, if I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your product? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

How are you, Chrissy? Good. How''s everybody doing over there? Good for Friday. Good for Friday. Yeah. Yeah, TGIF. It''s been a week. January was its own year, I''m pretty sure. Are you guys in St. Louis or Jeff City? St. Louis. Got it. Yeah. I was actually in Jeff City most of the week, but back in the office today. There you go. Yeah. Hey, Robert. Good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon. Jeff, I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know there''s several people invited, but I''ll just let you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off. Okay. I''m not sure who all is available on our end. Robert, thanks for hopping on. I think Andrew''s in another meeting, and I''m not sure about David, so it might just be us. Yeah, just know that we''re using Fathom. We''re recording it, so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join, but they can watch at their leisure. Well, thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call EvolutionX. You guys have been going down this path a little bit, trying to work with a vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already that''s fully vetted, everything that you''re looking to have in the solution, I think we have for you guys. We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you. CJ''s on the phone. CJ comes from EvolutionX. I''m your account manager from the Automate Sandpoint. I''m from Jeff City, Missouri. I''ve been doing this 39 years, so I''m happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well. But anyway, CJ''s going to kind of go over the product in a little high level. Please ask questions. This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward. So with that, I''m going to turn it over to you, CJ. Yeah, so Chrissy, Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team fairly extensively last year, and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo. But would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on EvolutionX, like who we are, how we work, any of that type of stuff? Or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake, just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just the cliff notes. I''ll give you 30,000 foot. If you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So EvolutionX e-commerce is a B2B e-commerce software. It''s been around about 17 years. And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago. And it was just because they had enough customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that ECI build an integration. It just made sense for them to buy us. And so now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates division and customer base. And so we''ve had several customers, I don''t know, throughout the last six months beginning to onboard, and it''s been a lot of fun. So just think of this as a robust B2B e-commerce software that would compete with any big box player out there. But we''re bringing it to the small, medium-sized distributor within the ECI family. Awesome. Cool. I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this. So this demo is for you guys. Stop me anywhere. We can pivot. I''m definitely going to be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform. But this is the flow that I''m going to go through. I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like. We''ll give you a back-end overview, and I''ll make a change on the home page of my website so you can see what would this look like for you to be able to manage. Some search functionality. Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded, you''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results. Some marketing tools, and then I will log in as a customer at the end so you can get a feel for what that''s going to look like for your customers. Okay. So I pulled a few customer examples here. He''s not. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, I misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here. We designed these in-house for you guys. So the way this would work, if you decide to go with EvolutionX, our design team consults with you, and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do no custom design, we can go a few different routes, and I''ve pulled examples of each. This is a fully custom homepage for a dealer that''s in the office supply space. They also sell some technology and other products as well. But I think from a design perspective, we can make this look any way you want it to look. Some people have a vision for what this dropdown might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side. A lot of different ways we can look to go about this, but I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology, any category of products, they should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for. So in this instance, we''ll just go to printers. If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees, we can have as many or as few of these as you want. But again, ideally these customers are going to be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website. What if they have a SKU and know exactly the product that they''re looking for? Yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable. 100%. So that''s where some of the search capability will come into play, where if you want them to be able to search by the product number, reference number, that can be done any way you guys want. We''ll have full flexibility over the search bar. Okay, so it can even index the description for, I put in Dell 14-inch 256 gig, it''s going to go, hey, here''s five results that have those words in the description. Yeah, it would pull up from the description, the category, the attributes, whatever fields we need to pull it from, absolutely. So I''ll look to show you a few different ways we could leverage the search bar, but that''s certainly one of them. Now, looking at less custom design, this website is one of our out-of-the-box themes. So at a base level, we have some templates or themes, we call them, that we can spin up, and essentially we would put your color scheme, your branding, your logo, we would put media in here from you guys, or we can supply it. But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like. If you want to have a shop by brand, a banner running across the site. So anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has a unique design. CJ, just a quick question, going back to the searching functionality. One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example, it doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description. Did I hear you say that EvoX actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely. Keywords, attributes. So you can go back on any given product, and there''s a field where you can say, we call it keywords, but if you type in a keyword and associate it with that product, it means that line of products will pop up whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it. And this, I think it''s important to note, I say that we''re a white glove service, but your arm in arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really good customer success team helping you build this website. A lot of this is we''re going to train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck. Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future, we don''t want to stand in your way. But if you do want help with these things, you''ll have live chat support from us. You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to pull up in search the way you want. But ideally, we''re going to help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live. That way the search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website. Awesome. Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up. They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little sub menus would pop up. So just giving you a feel for possibilities. I think we can design anything you guys would want. But this will be something to think about, Jeff and all of you, as we go down this road. If you do want Customization. We''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team. That way they can make recommendations and hear what you''re looking for, and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. Now, something way less glamorous is my demo store. I designed this, so don''t judge me. And I wouldn''t be the one designing your website, but I''ll use this just to navigate, move some stuff around, and go through the demo. Let me see. I''m actually going to log out of my user, and I''ll log back into him in a second. Back into the website. So when you guys log in, this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective. You''ll have access to some basic KPI and data reports. It''s surface level. There''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you, but at surface level, you''ll see order conversions, how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly, weekly basis. You can drag and drop and move any of this around. Chat support. Again, we do chat support US and UK hours, so it''s not quite 24-7, but it''s close. And these are actual solutions experts, not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem. So if you have an issue, you can chat our team. I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me, and they can grab your screen, send you articles, jump on a call. This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform. If you see a new button somewhere, this is a new feature we''ve added. We add features monthly. We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that. And I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool. So most dealers would have us, I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days. They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform, and we can still do that if you want, but it can be overkill for a lot of people. So we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into EvolutionX. So you can come in here and see how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest. What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at? Who''s the top users? You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website, how it''s trending. And I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant. Search results. So this will be, again, giving you data on when people come to your site, what keywords are they actually typing into the search bar? You might have something that is in your top 10 that''s unexpected. Well, when someone types that in, you''re going to want to make sure that the right products are popping up, as we discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything we''ve shown to this point? Are you able to slice those? Oh, sorry. Yeah, I was going to say, are you able to slice those analytics down to like a, from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day? Yep. Up here in the top. Yeah. And you can make it a custom range if you want. Awesome. So that''s good. What else? Jeff, did you have a question? Yeah. From the design perspective, I''m curious of your approach is from our perspective, do we create like a wire frame and give that to you guys? So you kind of know what to go from, or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times, your designers put together some options, and then we, you know, go through the approval process and editing process. Yeah, it can go either way. I don''t think it hurts to have a wire frame, but you don''t need one. And our team is definitely not accustomed to having one. So see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it, then certainly that helps, but most people don''t. Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you. And then we do go through an iterative process. So we''ll make a draft based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting. And then we might have to revise it three or four times. Okay. So that would be standard practice. But what I''ll show you next that Jeff has seen is once we build you this site, you''re going to have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes. And so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I use this jump to button in the top left, just because it''s quicker to get around. I''m going to type in layouts. So after the site is built, this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website. I''m going to go into the homepage. So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform, but you don''t have to. Most of this is meant to be drag and drop, no code. And so we house all of the media media content in these tiles that we call widgets. For example, I have a media gallery tile. If I open it up, I have an image of this office room. If I go to, let me log out of this user. If I go to the homepage of my website and scroll down, that image is right here on my website. So I just uploaded this from my desktop into this widget. I don''t need to know code. Now, if I did want to take it and say resize it, or I wanted to switch it to the other side of the website, you can kind of see all these boxes moving around in a very drag and drop format. So this is kind of the general concept of moving stuff around, what it looks like, all that good stuff. Now, what I am going to do, on my website, I have some items for sale. We call this an item merchandiser, and it says new products. Maybe it''s the end of the month, you''ve got a sale going on, and you want to highlight that and make it the first thing people see when they go to your website. I would come into this item merchandising widget and open it up. I''ll change the title to end of month specials. If you want different living, breathing list of product groups in here, you can have them. If you want to change how fast the carousel is running, you can make it two seconds versus three seconds. But I''ll just save my changes, and I''ll take this up to the top of my website. Resize it, save and publish. Cool. Now, if I go back to my website and hit refresh, that''s going to be a real-time change. So now you''ll see the end of month specials carousel hitting my website. And I could probably do that in less than a minute if I wasn''t talking. So, Jeff, would that mainly be you or would... Yeah, most likely I''ll be the one administering the site. Perfect. So, any questions about what it looks like to make a look and feel change or just any design-oriented stuff from that perspective from the rest of the team? No. A lot of flexibility and options. Yeah. CJ, one of the things that I do recall from a previous demo was how you showcased how we could feature specific brands or specific products. So, for example, right now we''re kind of doing a special on Dynabook, right? So, for the recording, for the folks that couldn''t be with us, would you mind just talking about how we can highlight certain brands or certain products and then run specials on those products? And then I remember even saying you could connect the product listing to like a blog article on such a product. So, would you mind just explaining to the team, please? Absolutely. So, a few different ways you can leverage the search results from maximizing brands or categories of products. The first point being if you wanted them to search a part number, SKU, reference number, you could do it that way. Another example, my demo store is set up to where if I type in copy paper, and I know this is an office supplies example, but you''ll get the point. I type in copy paper, I have my Evolution X copy paper showing up first. This is ambitious margins I''m shooting for, $350, but you get the point. I''ve got a banner displaying that, hey, 45% off, right? And so, that''s the general idea. Now, the way we set this up is pretty straightforward. On the back end, there''s a feature called brand priority. Again, our team will help you guys set this up before the site goes live, so you won''t be alone in figuring this out. But all I do is come in here and choose the brand that I''m looking to influence. I''ll just do 3M. And I could say I want 3M to be number one or number 10. Maybe you hate them and you want to bury them in the search results. We''ll say we want them to be number one, and then you would just open up what catalog we''re pulling from. I think it''s important to know we have a good amount of catalogs built into Evolution X. So, if you''re an approved vendor with a distributor network or a TD Cinex or Ingram, we can spin those up, and then you would just go select the catalog, and I''ll say technology, warranties. I want 3M to be the number one brand that pops up for this category. And so, that''s one way you can influence brands. It''s pretty straightforward. Another would be Let''s just see if I type in coffee maker, I have a media banner displaying above products. So yes, I typed in coffee maker, it''s pulling up all the coffee makers, but I have a bun coffee banner displaying above the products. So if somebody clicked that, it would take me directly to those products. There''s another way you can go about influencing the search results or the customer journey as well. You could get, I want to see if I have this set up, let me see stapler. I was going to say maybe staplers. I''ve seen some people do it where maybe it''s not a brand, but it''s a category. Like if I typed in staplers, maybe it pulls up desktop staplers instead of, I don''t know, like a heavy duty stapler. So it may not be a brand, maybe it''s a category you want showing up first. But Jeff, to your point, what we see people doing more and more is called guided selling. And so I think in your industry, we see this being valuable just from educating the customer on how to buy your products. So this is a furniture example, but you''ll get the point of how this could relate to what you''re wanting to do. If I''m on this customer''s website, Codex, and I''m looking for desk options, I can get to the products, but it also has this blog above the products that will educate me on how to select the best office desk, how to make sure it''s the correct height, how to choose the right size. And to Jeff''s point, you''ll notice that throughout this blog, links to cross-sell items that would be compatible with an office desk. So you can go big or small with this type of concept, but essentially guiding the customer towards purchasing a certain products. And then when I click office desks, it''s giving me the same type of experience, but eventually I can actually get to the product that I''m looking for. What questions do y''all have looking at that? So I love that for the new customers, the people that are new and fresh to the site. Honestly, though, also we will have customers where there''s an expectation of consistent repeat business. One of the customers, for example, that we''re trying to set this up for does have an e-commerce spend on technology hardware in the seven figure range. So for them, we want to make it a very convenient user experience. Can we talk just a little bit about how we could set up favorites and reorders and kind of making that convenient for quick purchases for people that are kind of reordering the same things? Or bundles and if they can be on a per customer. Absolutely. So what I''m about to show you, you guys will be able to do. On the back end, I''m going to go pull up some made up accounts that I have. So theoretically, this would be the accounts that are on here. If you want certain people in your company to only have access to certain accounts, that''s very doable. But I have CJ''s Furniture Co. as a made up account. Before I log in, just to show you, you''ll have some data at the organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history. You can track their spin, the trajectory of that, their search history, the top users, all of that stuff. But I''ll go log as a user here. So I have myself made up as an account and I''m going to go log in on my profile. So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do what I''m showing you right now, you could do that. You can target promotions to people specifically. Just to take a step back, I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer. So this is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The homepage of your website could look totally different as well. But when your customers log in, this is the portal experience that they''re going to have on your website. There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do, but you can put their logo. When they log in, instead of your logo, theirs is going to show up at the top of the website. Obviously, their user profile, you can put their headshot. They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history. They could quickly just click view, get into a recent order, print it, email it, or just click reorder all. And all those items will be added to the cart. So that''s one way. they could do a quick reorder. They have multiple saved carts. They''ll be able to view that, multiple credit cards. If two scenarios, if they have a budget assigned to them by their boss, this is where they can come in and check the status of their budget, the balance remaining. Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders. Or if they''re the person that has to approve the orders, those would all filter in the orders to approve field. But they''ll have access to some surface level stuff here. And then when they click their name, this side menu is going to come up. If you want to do rewards points, you can do stuff like that, like a traditional e-commerce type of feature. But a quick list would be what I think you call like a favorites list. So if I was a sales rep, I could go in and build these for my customers or the customer could do it themselves. But ideally, if every time I have to restock the copy room, I buy the same things, I would just put those items on a quick list. The quantities could be preset or a customer can just check a box and say add those items to the cart. These can be set up on recurring order. If they buy the same things on the same days of every month, no challenges with any of that. And all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process. CJ, quick question. Going back to the approver relationship, is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an automated email to the approver when one of his employees submits an order? Yeah, absolutely. So this is where you will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say, for example, I''m a CFO and you made me a super admin user. They could set this up or again, you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want. And so under advanced settings or approval settings, and I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load. Oh, there we go. So this is where they would come in and set their, there''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want. And then this trigger the email to your point. So if they wanted to track by cost center, so maybe they want to track spin by department. If they wanted to create budgets for specific users, they could come in and do that here. And if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month, anything above that''s going to acquire approval, they would save those settings. Then what we do on the backend, we have email templates that can be customized and we would just associate that template with that account for that event. So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens, we would just tie an email template to that workflow. So does that answer the question? Yep, it does. And in case you guys hear the alarms, we''re just doing our testing today. So it''s not like we''re a code red or anything. Okay, I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that. I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it. Okay. Yeah. We can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I was going to say it''s probably inconvenient for you. I thought it was the ice cream truck. That''d be nice. So you''re doing a good job of guiding me, Jeff. These are all the things I normally would show, but I want to keep this relevant to you. So what other things have we not hit on that you guys have questions about or want to see? So we have the capability to take credit cards through, I guess, the Stripe platform. And then we also have the option on here to accept or for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is. I''m assuming, Craig, are y''all using NetOne? I don''t know. We''re currently using Stripe to accept credit card payments. But I think to further Chrissy''s question, we''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with eAutomate from kind of an accounting perspective. Got it. So the short answer is yes. We can, like, I''ll show you the app store. You can certainly use Stripe. My store is actually set up with Stripe. But this is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services, HubSpot as a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here. But ideally, I know Craig can probably answer your questions about NetOne on a separate call. But if you wanted customers to obviously use NetOne or pay down using ACH, those are things that can be done as well. But Stripe, very doable. Chris, yeah, I''ll have some I get with you, Christy, on the NetOne side because the majority of our clients do use NetOne and interfaces with the Automate integrates, I mean, and also your customer info if you''re using that. So to me, it''s a no-brain must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in. We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate-wise and get you what those percentages would be. But yeah, let me get you in touch with them, guys. Okay. Great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not 100% what it would look like. This is a different ERP. But just on the customer portal and when we do integrate this to eAutomate, there will be an invoice history tab. And this is where they would come in and view their invoice history. Typically, these fields are clickable when it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP. So if they wanted to actually hyperlink and click into that, they could see it. But it will pull the invoice history for on and offline orders. So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still going to pull that invoice history for them to do 24-7. So that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal. Okay. I''m confused. I actually have two questions, CJ, one of which is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about. Do customers, shoppers, have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah. So we''ll show that. Chrissy, you said you''re confused? Yeah. Can you just recap this page that you''re on again? Yep. You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect. So Evolution X integrates with 30 different ERP systems. Oh, okay. So eAutomate is one. We work with a number of different. So the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to eAutomate for that reason. So I have a demo store that has some fake data to where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in, they will have an invoice history tab. So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website. Okay. I get it. The data doesn''t look exactly the same as what the eAutomate data will look like because this is fake data. Just to give you an idea of what it would look like, they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up. But anyway, we''re going to feed all orders. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history. And the reason that''s relevant is maybe, again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you, but you can still access their invoice history without having to call you, right? So it''s going to pull all orders on and offline. Nice. That''s awesome. CJ, I heard you say... Now, your question, I''ll show you. Sorry. I''m just going to circle back to that one. So I''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart. So this is where, again, like if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item, I could just open it up. Sorry, what were you about to ask? What was I going to ask? Sorry. Oh, yeah. No, it''s all good. I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps, and I heard MailChimp in there as well. Just curious about the integration of things like ConnectWise or Salesforce or Kaseya or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s what this looks like. EvolutionX is open API, so technically we can integrate with any third-party app. If we don''t have an existing integration, it may take some dev work. So there may just be a cost associated with that. And Salesforce would be a big one. Like we could integrate Salesforce, and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it. business case there, but the Salesforce is also very different for every company. The way we use Salesforce at ECI might be very different than you guys, and so it just takes a little bit of... The answer is yes, but there would be a dev cost associated with it, and I couldn''t even tell you what that is. Those kind of are done case by case. Okay. Are the capabilities there? Yeah, we can''t do it, so the platform is built to integrate. Okay. And so for guest users, we can hide published pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog? A thousand percent. You can customize this. Okay. Yep, based off of what their role is, and it''s all checkboxes for the most part. Like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing, you would just uncheck a box. What about like margin and markup rules? I''m assuming we can do that per company, per customer. Can we do it... Like how complicated can we get with the rules? Like can we say, hey, do 20% unless that puts it over MSRP, things like that? That''s typically data we pull from eAutomate. So if you''re talking just to the basic level, right, like you could call it contract pricing. Every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product. That''s all data that we pull real time from eAutomate. Now you could do it in EvolutionX as well. Just in order, some ERPs are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website, it has to match something you have in the ERP too for it to like push over correctly. But the answer is yes. I don''t know if I''m making sense on that explanation. I''m not an eAutomate user, so I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not. It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of eAutomate on our side. At a basic level, the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing, 100%. That is, I would say, a table stakes feature of EvolutionX. What other questions do you guys have? I can show you the blog feature. If you mentioned that, the AI blog. I don''t know, Jeff, that might just be your thing. I want to see it. It is. I''ll probably be supporting it a little bit, but I think it''s exciting for the other people on the call to just see how we can truly reinforce the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah. Two things I''ll show you. Something that is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer, and both are pretty cool. I feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other e-commerce products in the market, and I do think we''re doing the most with AI. This is the first thing we did about a year ago where... Give me a blog title, anybody. Benefits of what? What''s a break by? Benefits of Wi-Fi 6. Go for it. Go for it, Robert. Benefits of Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6, like this? Yep. Cool. Okay. I''ll type in the title. You can make the tone professional, casual, funny. We''ll do funny. You can adjust the word length, ask Evo XAI, and it''s going to start to spit out your blog for you. Now, you''re going to want to proofread it, but the results, it does spit out a pretty remarkable. Ideally, it''s trying to take away 70% of the lead time of writing a blog. Now, once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look, it will do the excerpt for you. It will do the meta information for search engine optimization. Kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating the buyer on how to buy office furniture. If you wanted to link products into the blog, this is just where you would come in. I''m just going to type in random numbers. You would type in the SKU, part number, the name, whatever, and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog. That''s just one example. ChatGPT is baked in here too, so if you needed ideas for a blog title, you could type that in and have it give you ideas. That''s current state, but I will show you... I think I have some slides here in this deck. Yes, here we go. We are adding Copilot to the platform. We have some... Customers in beta testing right now, but this will be a full AI assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well. And Jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this because it''s pretty new. But in this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month. It pulled that data. You tell it to create a 10% discount code for those items and name it best sellers of the month. So it will go do that for you. And then you say, can you essentially can you make a marketing page based off of these best sellers? Don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you that you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website. That''s insane. That''s awesome. Yeah. So I''ve got a few examples in this slide deck, but I think you get the point. Like any business data you want to pull, gross revenue, or if you want it to extend contracts as an example, this will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys. And that, again, we''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but this is the direction it''s going. So lots of cool stuff with AI. Yeah. Another question that is probably important to talk about is deal registration. Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m not. Craig might be. Yeah, fill me in. Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure. So a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers, they want to be able to forecast it. And so they will do partner-initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing. Those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days. And once we have that by saying, hey, customer ABC is going to buy 100 Dell laptops over the next six months, they go, cool, that''s awesome. Your new price for them is this. Okay. And ideally, it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Okay, cool. And so what''s your thought on, like, what are you wanting to do with that information on the e-commerce platform? Well, I mean, we pass some of the savings along, but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time. There''s not much in the IT marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup. You''re always going to end up with these deal reges and big deal pricing type stuff. Got it. So I''m going to show you, I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting. So it''s not just the pricing, but you''re wanting them to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain timeframe? I believe so. Yeah. Like if we could have something like your price, which is good through, you know, March 31st or something like that. Okay. So two thoughts on this, and I''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do. So the first thing you could do is make a promotion in the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example, I could say 10% off February. And again, like this is a generic title, but this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and the stop dates for the promotion. So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates, you could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer. And then you would select the promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting a dollar amount off or a percentage off, which would be, hey, within these dates, you''ve got a 10% discount. It''s going to generate a coupon code. Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe only five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend $300 to qualify. None of this might be relevant to your example, but you can set rules and conditions. And then whatever promotion you''re running, you would just apply it across a group of products. Can you apply that to a specific customer, though? Because these are customer specific. Yes, you can apply it. And I''m assuming you can do it without the coupon to where they just see the better pricing and know it''s big deal pricing or whatever. Yep. When they log in, you might have to display a few ways you could approach that, right? Like, yes, when they go in, there could be a notification on their portal. When you set this promotion, it could send them an email or as another layer, what you might need to do. And this, it''s a little bit of manual work, but this is honestly kind of just e-commerce. Let me just go badges. You would create a product badge that would display whatever text you''re wanting it to say above the product so they know that they''re getting a 10% off within this timeframe. Are those customizable? Yeah, so essentially you just type in the text that you want the badge to say, and then if you want to have a different hover text, and then the text color is just a hex code you can just select. Cool. So in the badge association, you can do on contract, so it can be for different customers, different users, however you want to go about that. So the application of some of these things that would be specific to a customer''s account or portal within the site would be for us having, what am I trying to say? So we''ll have the capability, say, to go into customer ABC and put specific badges on or make sure their pricing is in line with whatever deal registration we have with them. 100%. You''ll be able to log in. If you wanted to check out for a customer, you could, like if a sales rep had to place an order or send a customer a quote, you can build quotes on the back end. But the answer to your question is yes, you could do all of that or see all of that information on the customer profile. Awesome. Okay, cool. What about, so a customer purchases something, what are the rules of, hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this. This hit a dollar amount threshold or these are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return or whatever logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going, yep, got an order, place it. Yeah, so Craig, I wish we had Jamie here. We have a technical guy on the eAutomate side that could tell you what buttons we press to pause it better than I could, but I know that we do it with every ERP. So it could be certain orders or items or certain customers even, like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out and you want them to have to approve everything. That can all be customized. Some of it is dependent on the ERP though, like there''s some work that can be ERP specific. Sure, I mean. Technically how they set it up, but yes, we do that all the time. Well, and I imagine for, you know, we go live with this the first month or so, we probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure we''ve got all the kinks worked out just to lay eyes on it. We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders. You can give us a scenario that would concern you and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like, that''s one layer. And then like in all likelihood, all of your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might, typically people migrate them on in batches. Yeah, just so it''s digestible for you guys and you can get a feel for like, what does this look like? And it''s a customer you trust. And so, yeah. And Jeff will attest, I''m very good at breaking websites. Hey, they''re easy to break, man. It''s not a, yeah, it''s not difficult to do. I''ll tell you guys, I''ve been doing this 39 years and we''ve rolled out a lot of products and I am very proud of what CJ and the team has done. This product is amazing. And the integration we built into eAutomate only enhances it. So we''re excited about it. I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this. So they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution and it''s exciting to get it in front of you guys for sure. Awesome. CJ, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could, please. One of the challenges that we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution. A lot of times, we''re not getting prompt responses. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like and how we can make sure that we have the resources we need to make the solution successful? Yep. So two years during implementation, you''re gonna get assigned a technical person and more of a customer success person. So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole and they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you, they know you. So that''s an actual person, right, that you can reach out to. But the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use Intercom. We''re the only product within ECI that uses this. We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business. And so again, like you have our solutions experts live on here. These aren''t people that are gonna, like you have a problem, they''re not gonna say, yeah, let me get ahold of someone. They can solve the problem. Like those are the actual developers and solutions experts. And so if you put something in the chat that need help, like I said, I''ve never had a reply in over five minutes and they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles. They''re really, really, really good. So. So they will jump on a call? Oh yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And do you guys have SLAs in place for that? Or is that like, like you said, five minutes is the longest you''ve waited? So if you go in here, this, and this is really just to cover our base. It says we typically reply in under 20 minutes. There''s not a concrete SLA to answer your question. This is just me giving you a look and feel. But what I can do, like I''ll just put something vague in the chat right now. And as we''re talking, we can just see how long it takes them. I don''t know. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens. But no, like to answer your question. Well, I can''t see that far. Did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond right away? Typically, I didn''t tell them. If I tell them I''m on a demo, they will be like super quick. And so I did it on purpose. Because I do, I mean, like I am not, I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years. But I''m not a website person. Like I''ve never been a web developer. So these stores, I build them out myself and I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself. And so it''s quicker to get ahold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a Teams chat, like on Microsoft Teams. And so I use it all the time. And again, I''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but I''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. So how many people- They''re probably helping real customers instead. Say that again? They''re probably helping real customers instead. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. If they see something from me pop up, they''re probably annoyed, but that''s okay. They''re like, CJ, you should know that. No, but they, so we have a knowledge base. So sometimes what they''ll do, if it''s an answer that''s like, let me see, I might have to go to a different, I might have to go to my Edge browser to pull this up. If they, if it''s an answer that''s like in our knowledge base that you guys have access to, they might ping you an article real quick and say, hey, check paragraph five or something like that at a lease case. But you''ll have access to this as well. So it''s just another layer of like self-service. If there''s something that you have a question about, you can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials too. Cool. How many people- Oh yeah, I was just curious how big that support team is that manages that intercom. Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now. Got it. And there might be more. I normally can only see three, but we have 30. And again, keep in mind, there''s a team in the UK, or sorry, in the US, and then a bulk of them are in the UK as well. Yeah, you mentioned that earlier. So close to 24 seven. Not quite, but close. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So. Well, we are coming up on the hour. David, I see that you''ve joined. Do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time. I mean, it''s very informative. Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So no, all good. Great. Thank you, David. Robert, anything else on your side? I think I''m good. I think we just need somebody who knows how GFI uses the automate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which it''s the same company. So I know they''re fixable, but just to validate that, I would say would probably be good. Yeah, I agree. I know Andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us, so I''ll have a follow-up with him. And then I''m assuming at some point we need to get Susan involved in this conversation. I would assume so, because they''re going to have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from, you know, TD or whatever to this and then into eAutomate. Yeah, and she''s going to know, just so you guys know, too, before we got too involved or took this too far, we wanted to make sure we understood it and saw the fit. But then, you know, next steps for us is probably going to be getting, like, the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and reconciliation and that kind of stuff, because nobody on this call today touches that. And I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with what the process would look like and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless process there for both on our side but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now. But this has been great. I''m your non-technical demo guy, and so this is, Craig, that sounds like definitely Jamie and then maybe someone from Claire''s team you''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions. Okay. That sounds great. So Jamie is my SC on the eAutomate side. So he''s from the UK. So if we can look at a time, I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar in the morning if that''ll work for you, some morning next week. Jeff, I can talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys. But we''ll get Jamie and Claire on a call with your group, whoever that is, the new group, and go over any questions they have. Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that, Craig. So let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep. Sounds good. Any other questions for CJ? This is kind of the layout of integration, but we can get deeper in with Claire also. Yeah, this is high level. Just so everybody knows, implementation timeline typically around six months is safe. We can go faster. We can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week. You meet with our team, and that would be standard. Okay. Sounds good. Cool. All right, everybody. It''s great to meet you all. Jeff, if you need anything, don''t hesitate to reach out. But yeah, look forward to talking soon. Absolutely. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everybody. Thank you.

I know you guys are fabricating when it comes to certain like aircraft parts and things like that, I want to say. And so this is like from end of last year, early this year is when he was inquiring about it. I just wanted to follow up from that lead and see like kind of if he maybe came to a solution, but the lady up front, she had told me that there''s nobody named Eric and that you might be the best point of contact to talk about ERP. Is that correct? Yeah, maybe. Yeah, Eric hasn''t been here for a while. Okay. But yeah, no, we use a Pentagon 2000 ERP system.

If you had that time coming up here in the near future, maybe this week, we could do a phone call if that''s applicable, but I''d be kind of to show you how we help organizations like you guys kind of build that relationship a little bit. But end of day, if you guys already have a tool, that''s fine, but more so just a quick introductory call, learn about your guys'' processes and kind of see, you know, compare our tool a little bit with what you guys are using and see how that, you know, books out. Okay. Yeah. If you can email me some stuff, I''m probably not super interested right now. Like I have other things on the table, but if you send me some stuff, I surely will look, but definitely not looking to the, you know, switching or anything at the moment. Right. I mean, we''re not, yeah, I just want to reiterate, we''re not trying to get you guys to switch. It''s more so because of just the inquiry and now maybe he''s not there anymore, you mentioned, but it''s more so this intro call. I want to introduce ourselves, like I said, kind of get more familiar with what we do and then same time, just like have a quick comparison about certain features, the current tool you guys are using has, and maybe certain tools it doesn''t. And if that''s applicable to you guys'' business, whether it''s now, later down the road, X amount of years down whatsoever, right. You guys kind of know about how we help organizations like you. That''s all it is. I''d gladly send an email at the same time. If you do have about 15 minutes, I can always get that set up too over the phone. Yeah. I would say no for now, man. Cause yeah, I just, my brain is just not there to where I''m going to even like entertain the possibility. But if I''m in pain and looking for something, I''ll definitely reach out. But yeah, I''ll say right now, it''s just not something. Yeah. No worries. So I can send over an email real quick. What is a good email for you? Cause I have Eric''s info, but. Sure. If you send sales at airplanes.com. You said Rafael, is that correct? Yeah. All right. Gotcha. All right. I''ll send over a quick like email.

The customer''s profile everything is all added into the system because it''s already done. The you know, the customer registration the past and then quotation is issued. Then the next thing is we get a PO. We review the PO. We accept the order that gets put into the ERP. Okay, so we have we have all the documents to show. That a quotation was that was issued PO was received. Order was acknowledged and we give a copy of the order acknowledgement to the customer. And then you know, then if I want to attach any documents or anything like that, maybe I scribble a sketch or something. I want to scan that and I want to load it into the into this ERP system. You know, I can do that also, you know, so there''s some flexibility in there. And then after that now now I have to now to order the parts to make this valve, right? So most of my business is purchased from out. I don''t do manufacturing. Okay. I mean not in a machine shop for now. Okay, so I''m going to qualify myself as for now. So most of the parts are purchased from outside. Let''s say I got 10 vendors. They are in my AVL same thing. I key in the part number boom and I issue out of PO''s to my vendors. And then of course the next process is items get delivered to me. So it comes in we do a call receiving inspection. We put to stock and then after this we draw it from stock and issue out against the order and then it''s packed and shipped out to against the order. All that is all captured in the ERP and then it comes to invoicing. I press the button invoices are generated. We send the invoice to the customer and then we track the payment. Now payment is not received after 30 days. Let''s say there''s a net 30 day. Then I just press a button. I can see all my orders that are outstanding. So then we will start chasing the customers one by one, you know, for the payments. Payments been received. For example, we review that against our bank invoice and then we acknowledge and say, yep. Okay, money has been received. We can close the order out, you know, and then then of course I''ve got inventory, you know, so I bought some stuff. I kept it into my factory, kept it in my factory. So I got inventory management. Not on a big scale. We are very small. Our turnover is about a million dollars per year. All right. Okay, so this is what I''m looking for. For a start. Yeah. No, I mean, hey, yeah. I know. Thanks for the rough overview. First of all, so Bill, he is pretty much my guy. He is the one that''s going to kind of go more over that kind of see the things you''re looking for. He can kind of create you like a profile and attach kind of everything you''re looking for, right? How you mentioned from the outside source as well as inventory orders, the invoice, kind of all that whole spiel kind of he can kind of go more in depth in that he would want to do a discovery call and then he kind of show you how our system can work and he''ll create like a obviously like a customized demo for you. But before he even does that, he''d want to do discovery calls, learn more about the process, how you guys are handling it right now and then go to the next step. So, I mean, if that does, if you have time, we can get something scheduled. It wouldn''t be over Microsoft Teams. Yeah. And yeah, so we can get that scheduled and then okay. Yeah. So let me see here. No, just we know price price. Okay. I mean you may have the solution that I needed, right? But if your price is not within my budget, then I''m sorry, I can''t go for it. Right. So price wise it varies obviously like how the solution is going to be what parts of the solution you''re using, how it''s tailored, all that kind of stuff. Same time. We do have a couple ERPs. I''m going to connect you with Bill on our M1 ERP. I think just based off of certain things, looking to move to cloud, things like that. This makes more sense. We do have a couple alternatives, right? If it comes to that from a price standpoint, certain things you are looking at, we can always look at that direction too. Does that make sense? So what''s your price? I don''t know. I can''t tell you the price. Honestly, it''s something I can''t tell you right now, nor do I know what it is or a rough ballpark just because it varies so much from what you guys are using within the platform, how big you obviously guys are kind of, you know, you mentioned pretty small, but still it can vary a lot. So he''s going to be the one to give you more of that detail. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Let me see here. Do you want to do this week? Do you have time this week? I''m looking at like... Yeah. Yeah, this week is okay. Is tomorrow... Tomorrow is fine. Central time, if that''s possible. Afternoon, I got time. Yeah, that''s fine. Send me a... I''m okay. I''m all right. I''m free tomorrow afternoon. Yeah, two o''clock Central? Yeah, two o''clock Central is all right. And then I just need to confirm your email real quick. I have on my file as rohan.perera.atjvsendg.com. That''s correct. Okay, awesome. All right, I''ll get the invite sent out and then we can obviously talk there. Okay. Awesome. All right. Sounds good. Thank you so much, Rohan. Okay. Thank you. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Oh, hey, Abby. It''s Jamie with ECI. How you doing? I''m doing good. How are you doing? Yeah, not too shabby. Abby, I had some information that you requested, maybe more background regarding Bolt and kind of see how that works for you guys. Is that correct? Yeah, well, I have worked with Vantage Homes, and I was just trying to register for the program, I guess, for the ITK. Oh, for the Builder Portal. Okay. Yeah. Okay, gotcha. Yeah, yeah. So I guess if you filled that out, let''s see, do you have access to the portal itself and you''re just trying to set up an account? Yes, yes. Okay, okay. So then someone through with our customer service should reach out to you. Were you having any issues with it? Any message I should pass along maybe? The only issue I''m having is that I''m also with Challenger Homes, and I just wanted to merge those. Oh, yes, ma''am. Yeah, so that''s definitely possible. That way you''re not like paying multiple like account fees there. Let me actually, so I have a special number or email that you can reach out to. Let me pull that up for you real quick. Okay. Okay. Yeah, let me know when you''re ready. I''ve got an email and a phone number here for you. Okay, I''m ready. Okay, so that email is going to be support, just spelled out S-U-P-P-O-R-T at E-C-I solutions.com. So you can email them that way or you can call the number. It''s going to be 866-374-3221. Okay, sounds good. I will reach out to them and see if they can help me with that. Yeah, yeah, of course. And Abby, while I have you here, now since you guys are working with new home builders there, are you familiar with our platform Bolt as well? No, I have not used that. Yeah, that''s okay. Just kind of real quick and high level. Now ITK we own as well, but obviously for our builders, but we very much work with our trade contractors as well. And now Bolt, now it sounds like you''re logging into multiple portals that are builders that use ITK. And if you''re working with some other ones as well, now this isn''t something that just works with ITK. It is really just a project management platform to use internally. So to centralize and automate those portals and pull everything into one system for you guys, just kind of an all-in-one centralized job detail situation. So wanted to bring that by as well and see if that''s something you might want to just peek at for about 15-20 minutes in the next week or so. Okay, yeah, that would be fine. Okay, awesome. And Abby, just to make sure we don''t waste your time now, obviously it sounds like you''re working with multiple home builders. I know I''ve heard of Challenger, typically more on the high volume side of single family construction. But what''s that look like for you? How many new homes are you guys doing per month at the moment? It varies. Some days we have some slow months and other times we have steady. Yeah, okay, well I guess just kind of an average number if you had to guess on your good months. I would say we''re doing like maybe 60 to about 100. On a monthly basis? Yeah. Okay, okay, awesome. Yeah, no, perfect. So I just want to make sure that, you know, because we don''t want to sit here and give you information on something that we want to help you if the volume wasn''t there as well. So we''ll definitely make sure there''s a return on investment if this is something that you wanted to move forward with. But really we just want to, we''ll schedule this call, just kind of understand current workflow, maybe any challenges you''re having. Now if I could just ask a couple more questions, how many crews do you guys have out there? We have two. Two crews and how many men in each of those crews? Each one has four guys. Awesome, awesome. And then so I heard Challenger, Vantage, any other builders you''re working with? We work with Classic, Ask a Few, Trayvon, and then we do quite a few custom homes. Awesome. Okay, perfect. Yeah, we work with people kind of across the board there on that front too. Okay. Yeah, and then as far as internally, do you guys have a system like that or is it more like emails, phone calls, logging into all the portals on a daily basis? Yeah, yeah, just kind of, we don''t have a system so we just do the emails and whatever login portals the builder has. Okay, awesome. All right, Abby, well yeah, I won''t take up too much more of your time here. We''ll get a call scheduled. I mean, do you have time later today even or tomorrow? And just confirming you are in Larkspur, Colorado? Yeah, sometime today, later today should be fine. Okay, awesome. So I''ve got Aaron over that territory. He looks like he might be a little busy. We''ve got Tim here too, so let me reach out to them. I''m actually right down the street from you here in Colorado Springs. Let''s see, does, let me pull up Tim''s, does maybe hours will work for you? He''ll just give you a quick ring. Yeah, that''s fine. Okay, perfect, Abby. And that''ll be really quickly and then you can find time to schedule a demo from there. Now that''s probably going to be more like an hour just so you can really see how the system would work for you guys. So quick call today and then look for at the calendar for about an hour to squeeze a demo in. Okay, that works. All right, perfect, Abby. You have a great day. We''ll call you later.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Abby and Jamie from ECI discussed Abby''s registration issues with the Builder Portal and merging accounts for Challenger Homes and Vantage Homes. Jamie provided support contact details and introduced ECI''s project management platform, Bolt, as a potential solution for Abby''s workflow challenges. They also scheduled a follow-up call to explore the platform further.

Hey, good afternoon, Julia. My name is Hector. I''m with UCI Manufacturing Job Boss. How are you doing?

With who?

Job Boss.

Oh, Job Boss.

Yeah, I was reaching out to introduce myself. I think you had spoken with my colleague, Hannah. I just took over her territory and just wanted to introduce myself and let you know I''d be your first point of contact regarding any support regarding Job Boss. Yeah, just kind of wanted to see where you guys were at and see how the search was going for ERP solutions.

Let''s see. Actually, if you can do a Zoom presentation, are you available today?

Zoom presentation? So I''m the scheduler for the solutions expert, Holly. I can take a look if she''s available today. Give me one second here. What time were you looking at?

Maybe within an hour or two.

Oh, she''s pretty. Let me see. Give me one second. Let me see if she responds real quick. But yeah, I kind of just wanted to learn a little bit more about what you guys are doing. I have some pretty good notes here regarding kind of what you guys are looking for. Anything top of mind? Anything particularly you''d like to share? So we''re a CNC machine shop. Correct. And it''s a small size. I think for the ERP system, we''re looking for something that''s efficient. But I''m not too sure if we really need the ERP system since we''re really small. Okay. How many employees are we talking here? We have six. Okay. We''re actually made specifically for medium to small size job shops manufacturing. Are you guys mainly doing custom made to order things or made to stock? Yeah, made to order, made to stock, mostly prototypes. Mostly prototypes. Okay. And what are some of the challenges you guys are currently facing? What are you guys currently using? We don''t need the ERP right now. I''m just getting orders through emails or we use platforms. Okay. I think what I want is something a little bit more efficient. I know that maybe JobBoss offers something where I can tag material, tag my travelers. Correct. Yeah. And I see you guys are looking to pursue AS9100 certification and ITAR registration. Yeah, we''re pursuing that right now. Nice. So what percent would you say it''s made to order for you guys? 100%. Perfect. And is it just one location we''re talking here? One location. Okay. And are you guys needing integrated financials, production forecasting, or warehouse management? No. Okay. And kind of what you guys are doing, I know you''re CNC machining. How complex are your bill of materials? Or do you guys have any sub-assemblies, anything like that? No assembly. If it''s simple assembly, not welding or... Yeah. Okay. She currently has back-to-back meetings the rest of the day. Let''s see here. Did you have some availability maybe tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Do you have a number at the top of your head how much it will cost monthly? Not necessarily. For a small business? She could go over that with you. She could ballpark it for you in that conversation. So just for full transparency, kind of the way we go about how we do this is I''m the scheduler, like I said, a scheduled call with Holly, which is a solutions expert, for a discovery call, just kind of seeing if we''re a right fit for you guys. And then if you see some value there, it''ll proceed to a demo. Okay. A demo based on that discovery conversation. That''s why we like to have those, just so we''re not wasting your guys'' time, trying to show you a demo that wouldn''t make sense if we''re not a fit for you guys and if we don''t know some more details about the business. But yeah, if you see some value in that conversation, then we''ll proceed to a demo. In that actual discovery call, you could go over pricing, ballpark pricing, as well as she''ll show you some of the job boss aspect of it. She''ll kind of show you the software, kind of how it works. But the demo, if you decide to go forward with the demo, that''s where you''ll see more in depth. But those questions she could definitely answer for you in the discovery call. Okay, sounds good. What time do you have some availability for tomorrow? I can do 11. 11 a.m.? Let me double check. She is busy. She''s one of our busier reps. Let''s see here. Did you have some time for tomorrow? She has availability for tomorrow at either 8 a.m. or what is this? 2 p.m. 2.30 as well as 3. If anything, I''ll just give you a call back to schedule this. Okay. Okay, thank you.

It''s coming up with a login screen. Usually it just authenticates and it pulls up, but it''s saying that we need to log in and then when we try to log in, we''re getting an error message. What''s the error say? Hold on one sec. And this is everyone? Yes. Oh wow, okay. Now I''m not getting an error message, but it just says authentication authorization required by HTTP, PGSQL, username, password, we enter in our username and password and it just keeps going in. And then when I try to get into the McCullough local and logging in, it just says login failed. Okay, so this sounds like you''re remoting into a server and then that''s what you''re using to get into McCullough, right? Yes. Okay, have you talked to your IT about the server? Yes, and he confirmed that both the domain server and the SQL server are up and communicating. Domain and SQL server are communicating. Okay, did they do any recent updates or anything that could push us in this direction? No, just logged in today and nobody can get in. We had a power outage, so we thought maybe that had something to do with it, but he got into his office and confirmed that SQL and domain servers are up and communicating and nothing else is affected. Okay, that is interesting here. Let''s go ahead. I''d like to remote in, Sue, and take a look, but I am actually getting, you called at such a good time. So what I''m going to do, I''m going to cancel my next meeting. I want to help you guys here. Sue, what number can I give you?

Are they close by or do you have to call out to those guys? No, we have to call out. Okay. Yeah, we''ll get them all aligned and then if needed, I can remote into his workstation. I think he can remote into yours. So we''ll get that all squared here. All right. I will give you a call back in about two minutes or so here. All right. What''s your name? It''s Reginald.

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good. How are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point to in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions, so I''ll just let you go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question, but essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and ideally I look at, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal, they can see all the bends, and then they can order, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your product? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about maybe 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, you all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works a lot of the shops out there, and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs, and I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said, so very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here, and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s. And that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird. It''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people. And then it became, you know, more of a focus. So I guess it is, you know, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and, you know, through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point to in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshcut or Semcut Send. A lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? Like when someone uploads, if I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey Sabrina, it''s Tim over at Bolt Software. Hey Tim. How are you doing? I''m doing okay. All right, all right. Gonna make it. It''s the weekend and it''s a long one, so I''ll take it. My wife and I are going on vacation, celebrating our anniversary and her birthday. Well, congratulations both directions. Yeah, we are in the final hours. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, I hope that I don''t take up too much of your time. So I''m really walking into this blind. I don''t really know how to start this, so I''ll let you go and then I''ll give you the information that you need. Yeah, for sure. I do this every day, all day, so I''m happy to guide you through this process, no problem. I am curious, how did you hear about us? Well, so the owner of the company has a friend that apparently uses you guys. I don''t know which friend this is. I don''t know what business that it''s really for. So he told me about it the other day, sent me a link, and I was just kind of going over it. And I''m like, look, I don''t know if it''ll work for us, but it''s worth a phone call. It''s worth asking questions, giving them information, and seeing where we land with this. So that''s where we are. Love it. Sounds good. So the way that I find it best is I can give you a 30,000-foot flyover of who we work with and what we do. And then I''ll kind of just ask some questions about your business. And at the end of this, the whole idea is just to see if it makes sense to progress to a demo, or I''ll tell you, hey, this system is not built for you guys. I don''t think it''s worth your time. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that''s perfect. Cool. So just at a very high level, we are a software product built specifically for trade contractors that work with production home builders or custom home builders to a degree. But from the ground up, we are designed to centralize the PO management process. If you''re working out of builder portals like BuildPro, SupplyPro, BuilderTrend, ITK, stuff like that, and try to bring all of that into one place to make it easy to track all the details to every project, such as scheduling, such as documents, photos, time tracking, contracts that you agree with the builder on, things of that nature. And then we provide your team with a mobile app so that everybody''s aligned in real time. They can take photos in the field, send pictures back to the office, and then you have the way of tracking billing and getting that information into an accounting system so that everything just syncs up and it''s just one unified single source of truth. Okay. Big things that we typically help with are companies who are really struggling to just stay on top of the schedules because things change so consistently in this line of work. They just need an easier way to make those changes and ensure they don''t waste trips to job sites, make sure that it''s easy to track changes in the field. If the builder needs additional work that wasn''t originally a part of the plan, just making sure that gets communicated in real time, and just making sure you''re not entering the same information across multiple systems or putting on a whiteboard that gets erased, things like that. Okay. Does that help a little bit? Yeah, and so let me tell you, I mean, and I kind of gathered that because I was, you know, obviously I was Googling and all the wonderful things, resources, just reading the testimonies from your clients. I don''t know specifically that this is really geared toward us, so let me tell you about us. We are a small lawn and landscape company. We do yard maintenance for customers. We aren''t necessarily in line with building, quote unquote. We will go do landscaping after something is built, but as far as the actual construction, we''re not in that line at all. And we work out of QuickBooks, and we''re such a small company that we literally have an admin staff of three, and we use QuickBooks. I''ve been with the company almost two years, not quite. We don''t even use a PO system here. We don''t use POs through QuickBooks, even though I would love to have a procurement process, for the work that happens, it just doesn''t work. We hire a lot of H-2A workers to do our lawn and landscape work for us. So we have a bit of a, I''m trying to be professional and get my words right here. So we do use a whiteboard for, you know, we have a customer that wants a landscape, that''s what goes on our board, or sod or something like that. Our guys aren''t very technical. There''s language barriers. There''s, what am I trying to say? We write in English, they like to write in Spanish. And so there''s that, you know, that as well. So given that, do you still see that this is something that would be geared toward us? Yes, mostly. There''s still a couple things I want to clarify before we continue like fully. But it''s like, this is, so just so you know, you can say and speak your language however you like. I have been in construction since birth. When I was born, my dad had a framing business that he was running. He''s a home builder now, but he has been, I''ve been in and around this industry my entire life. I owned my own construction cleaning business for seven years. So however you say things is totally fine with me. I will understand. And if I don''t understand, I''ll ask. But I''ve also worked with a lot of landscaping companies. And a lot of the things that you just said are pretty much ring true for every landscaping company I''ve talked to. So the language barrier, not a problem. We built this system here in Texas. It was built by an electrician. And he had the exact same concern when he started building software for his company is like, how the heck is this going to work? Our app is Spanish friendly, so it translates the information for your Spanish crews to make it easier for you guys to communicate. Okay. And so if the guys are in the field and they''re, okay, so I guess I should let you just keep going because right now, I guess I don''t completely, you know, obviously I don''t understand how the whole thing works. So yeah, you go ahead. Yeah, and we''ll get to the demo and walk you through how the product works and everything. But who are some of your customers? Well, our customers are just residential for the most part. We have, we do the McDonald''s landscaping in the Southeast Texas area. We handle Smurfett Westrock, their Eva Dell facility. We do their lawn maintenance and their janitorial services. That, however, might, might would be a different animal within itself. The janitorial because it''s ran through the customer''s software, which is track. So there''s things that have to be done in there. I don''t really know how that would feed into this. That could actually be part of a different conversation, I guess. But as far as commercial, it''s really just the McDonald''s that we do at this point. We don''t have a lot of commercial activity. We are 98% residential. Okay. And the residential side, are you installing new landscape and sod? Are you doing irrigation? Or are you purely just, hey, like I own my home. I have somebody that comes on a biweekly basis and mows my yard and takes care. And then once a season, they do the remulch. They put flowers down, stuff like that. We do every bit of the above. Okay. So you do new installations. We do new installations. We do, we clean up existing. We do new irrigation or we will go repair, replace parts on older or, you know, irrigation systems that we didn''t do. So what percentage, so for those new installations, are those still, are those all directly with the homeowners? Are those with like home builders? Nope. Home owners. Okay. What percentage would you say is new install versus service work? Gosh, we have so many repeat customers until I would venture to say probably, probably 65 to 70%, 75%. And it may be a little bit higher. It just, it varies so much from year to year, but would be our repeat customers. And then everyone else. That''s not ours. That''s y''all''s. It''s going to be new. Okay. And then how many customers do you guys currently have? Currently we probably have 115, 120. And you said you''re managing the scheduling aspect all on a whiteboard? Yes, it''s literally the scheduling, it''s very basic because it can''t be complicated, right? I''m going to do a landscape job for you, I''m coming on this day. That''s really the part of it. So yeah, we do it on a whiteboard. It''s split into two parts, the top month, the bottom month, and we write the days on it, and these are the days we''re going to be there. Yeah, and how are you communicating that to the crews? The crews get work orders, they get punch lists, and then we talk about it with them as well, but they actually have the physical copies. Y''all have like a morning meeting where you''re like, okay, you guys are going to these jobs, here''s your paperwork? So here''s the process, and these are, let me just say, this is the process. So the owner and his son are the two that really drive the crews. And so the owner, his son, and our estimating scheduler, they meet in the morning, and our nursery manager, they will meet in the mornings to go over previous day''s work, current day work, and then the owner and his son are the ones that are actually communicating with the guys and dictating to them when, where, why, how. They''re the ones making changes, so it''s really those two that are directing the traffic. Gotcha. And another question I have, are you guys, are y''all picking up your materials, your sod, things like that from a yard, or do y''all basically have it all in-house and have your own managing? No, we get that from turf farms. Okay, cool. So what do you think, did he mention why he thought it would be a good idea to explore this system, anything specific on that front? Yes, and I''m going to be blatantly honest. So in the office of a staff of literally three, I''m the office manager, I do billing, AP, payroll, Kevin''s personal assistant, everything. And then I have a lady that does all the estimating and scheduling, and then we''ve got Kevin and Kyler. So there''s frustrations. If we put a schedule together, but we don''t follow the process to follow that schedule, and changes are made, but that is not communicated across the board, then obviously there''s frustrations that take place, right? So that''s ultimately, in a nutshell, that''s why I''m talking to you, because that seems to happen, and he gets frustrated, and then he talks to his friends, you know, well, this is great, this works, and I''m going, well, they''re also running, you know, $80 million, we''re running six. And I''m not beating us down at all, that''s great for our industry in this area. Oh, yeah. But it''s really, we have the paper, do we need the paper, would it be easier if nobody had paper, if everybody was working off of a, you know, electronically, well, I don''t know the answer to that. You know, I think there''s limitations with our team to a degree, but is it trainable? Probably. Yeah, and I''ll let you know now, if you guys do decide to partner up with us, and it seems like something that would work for you, we''ll take care of the training aspect. We have that built in on our side. We have an entire team dedicated to ensuring that you get set up properly. So walk me through more of these frustrations. Why are they occurring exactly? Well, a lot of our business, like I said, they''re repeat customers, and so a lot of our customers have, you know, Kevin on speed dial, or they have his phone number, or certain things come up, and so they''ll call Kevin, and they''ll want this done, and he''s moving things around, and he''s busy, and maybe he forgets to tell us, or the information doesn''t come across correctly, and, you know, myself and the estimator and scheduler, Ms. Laura, we''re only as good as the information we''re given. So let me give you a little bit of how the process, once they''re on the board, well, just bear with me one second. So a customer calls, and we put the meeting on Kevin''s calendar. He''s the one that actually goes out and meets with the customer. He takes a piece of graph paper with him, and he writes notes in his own way, and he''ll do a very rough sketch of what the conversation is about, how they''re wanting things to look, and, you know, the list of things that they''re wanting, whether it''s stone or mulch or whatever, whatever, whatever, and he brings that back to the office. Now, from that piece of graph paper with his scratch on and his rough sketch, we, my estimator and scheduler, Miss Laura, has to decipher what he''s saying. So we take that, break it down, and build the estimate into QuickBooks off of this piece of graph paper. Now, we created a nice form. You know, we had an operations manager that came on board, created a nice form, asked him to use it. It was rejected right up front. Was not using it, and he still never did. So that is how the process starts. So that in itself is a lot of frustration. When he is seeing four to five people a day, and he''s 30 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and it''s very rough. It takes a lot of time to figure out what he''s trying to tell us sometimes. And a lot of times it''s not complete. You know, we''re constantly having to ask him questions. Well, what is this? And if you want this, then where''s it at on the drawing? And you know what I mean? It''s just a lot of back and forth. That in itself is probably the biggest thorn with the upfront process, getting it from the paper into the system. And then, you know, once it goes to the customer, once it''s an estimate, it goes to the customer, then it''s volleying back and forth with them. Well, I don''t like this. I want to change this. I want to add this, yada, yada, whatever. And then among that, we have to make sure that all these changes that the customer is making is getting into their file, into QuickBooks, and to the guys. You know, because we don''t want to leave anything out, obviously. So here in lies the frustration. You know, something''s getting missed because somebody''s not telling us something, or, you know, we''re not deciphering correctly, or this was forgotten on the list, or, you know, you didn''t understand them correctly. They asked for this, but they didn''t know what they were asking for, that whole thing. Who''s managing those changes? Is that also Kevin, or is that whoever''s building the estimate? At what point? Well, you said that, so Kevin goes out there, does the chicken scratch doctor''s handwriting to pull it together with the customers trying to, like, communicate. He then brings that back to you guys in the office. Somebody creates an estimate out of that information in QuickBooks, and then the estimate goes back to the customer, right? Correct. And then the customer is going to make changes because they don''t know what they''re asking for. They have no clue what the heck landscaping even means. So then things are just getting moved around. Is that, who''s the changes in that process being communicated to? Is that going to Kevin back to you guys again, or is that going directly to the estimator? That''s going, it''s ultimately, I mean, oh my gosh, initially it''s going to the estimator, Ms. Laura, my clerk that puts them together. However, we typically have to run them by Kevin just to make sure that it will work. You know, they may have a small spot and they want, you know, an oak tree, but they don''t realize that that oak tree gets 50 foot tall. You know what I mean? So it goes to Laura first. If it''s something, you know, because we do it so much, a lot of times she can say, oh, well, that will work. Ultimately, it''s your house. You can do what you want, but, you know, let me run it by Kevin to make sure that it''s going to work there or see if there''s an alternative to that for you. So between Laura and Kevin, it really bounces back and forth until the customer says, okay, I approve that. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I really appreciate you just painting the picture for me and telling me how this process gets communicated because every time I talk to a landscaper, this is one of the more chaotic processes within their business is how this all unfolds. Yeah, it''s crazy. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the estimate gets done and you and the customer agree that this is the plan. What are the next steps from there? Okay. So once we agree that they pay their deposit and we schedule them on our board, our calendar, and they are notified, hey, we''re coming out in two weeks. You know, we''re going to be there in the morning or the afternoon. And so we get to that point the day before we print or the week of, we print all the work orders for the guys. We put them in their boxes so that they can familiarize themselves with, you know, what''s going on. In between that, you know, someone''s pulling the plants. You know, there''s things once the estimate is approved, we make sure we have those plants on site in the nursery or that they''ve been ordered so that, you know, everything''s ready for the job. And then the week of, the work orders are printed and they''re given to the guys. And then we walk through the rest of that process. And then after the job''s completed, then you bill the rest of the remaining amount? That is correct. Once the job is completed, the guys have a foreman''s report that they fill out that because just because we bid 15 yards of mulch doesn''t mean we''re going to use that much. So the foreman''s report is the actual finalized number for the product or material being used. And once they bring that foreman''s report in after the job is completed, then Laura, if need be, will modify those quantities and then she will send the final invoice. And that''s all done through QuickBooks? Correct. Cool. Okay. And then are there ever changes that come up whenever your guys go out to the, are on the job? Every single day. Every day. Every day. How are those being communicated and tracked? So most of the time they''re on site, customer walks out, hey, can you add or can you do, they''ll call into the office to Laura and say, hey, she''s wanting to add or she''s wanting to do. And so, you know, Laura''s making note of that. In the meantime, we''ve got somebody coming back to the yard to pick up whatever it is that they''re wanting to add and take it to the site so that it can be done at that time. Do they ever not call Laura and they just do it? Yes. Yes. If it''s, you know, if they''ve taken, well, not even if they''ve taken extra, there are times when the customer will ask for something and, you know, Kyler, you know, will come back, grab it and take it. And then after the fact, you know, it''s on the foreman''s report and she''s like, well, what is this? It wasn''t on the estimate. Well, they wanted it, you know, when we got there or she said this before we left. Yeah, that happens a lot. Does it ever not make it on the foreman''s report? Yes. Yeah? Yes. All right. Yes. And I think it''s probably just in, you know, everybody''s trying to do what, you know, what we''ve got laid out and it''s just in the middle of it and they just, you know, forget to write it down or, you know, it''s just not accounted for or whatever, but it''s not often, but it does happen. Anything else going on just in the general process? No, I mean, that''s, because once it gets to the point of the final invoice being sent to the customer, then it''s, you know, then it''s just accounts receivable collecting on that invoice. And then the process just starts over, you know. Now, once, the one thing that we do that I request just from a financial perspective and the way QuickBooks handles things is if we create an estimate and the customer approves that estimate and we collect the deposit on that estimate, then if they call a couple of days later and say, oh, well, I want to add such and such or I want you to give me a quote on such and such, then I have Laura go in and create a whole new estimate because we''ve already applied a payment to that specific transaction because the way QuickBooks works is once it''s been approved and accepted, then it has to be converted to an actual invoice. So once it becomes an actual invoice, then it starts hitting my financials. And so if I apply a payment to it, but then you go in and you start adding to it, then things are wonky. So we do have, you know, those instances where we''ve already started this estimate. Oh, well, now I want to add this, but we just do it as a completely new estimate just to keep the books clean. Other than those pieces, it''s really, really that. That is the hiccup in the whole process. To me, it''s not even the whiteboard. You know, it''s not that. It''s communication for number one. And then, you know, well, I guess communication is really it across the board because if anything is changed and it''s not communicated to Laura, then she doesn''t know to revise it. If the guys do something in the field and doesn''t tell Laura or Kyler or myself, then again, here we are, you know, chasing tail. Well, what I can tell you is that landscapers pretty much across the board all have a service component to their business. Whether they work with production builders or not, service is always going to be a big part of landscaping more so than pretty much any other trade I work with just because it''s really, really easy to like basically put, install landscapes and then build a relationship with the customer and retain that business as a regular business, right? Right, right. And we, the landscapers I''ve worked with have been very successful using our system for the things that you''re describing, especially when it comes to communication breakdowns because whenever you change something in the system, it changes on a global scale. So if Kevin needs to reschedule a job in the field from the mobile app, that''s going to automatically update on your schedules in the office. But we can also, again, pictures and documentation. We can put these forms that you guys are using to build your estimates. We can template that out in our system so that Kevin can just draw on a PDF in our app, make the notes, check off boxes, send that to you guys. We even have talk-to-text, which I think is what we would push him to use. He would not, I can tell you. He won''t do it. He won''t click a button and just talk to the phone rather than typing. No, I''m sure he will not. Hey, you know what? There''s a first time for everything, and he may prove me 100% wrong. Well, I find it interesting that he would push you to take a look at a software system, but he''s not willing to use the software. Yeah, no, I completely agree. Yeah, I mean, we brought an operations manager on board to identify efficiencies or inefficiencies, and he ain''t here no more. And I''m just being, I mean, I am very black and white. There''s no gray area, you know, so I''m not about to waste your time or anything. No, you''re good. So I want you to know what it is. I would love to know who he talked to who pushed him toward this because that would help me a lot in just being like, I mean, I can tell you whoever you talk to is using the system this way, and they''re successful because of it. And I will definitely try to find out. But you know what? Let''s say for the sake of argument that he says, okay, I''ll do that. I''ll use talk to text. I use talk to text every single day of my life, and it''s great. It saves me a lot of keystrokes. It saves me a lot of time. We have this really cool ability. So in the mobile app, you can have documents, right, and you can edit these documents. And there''s a specific thing you can do where you can actually on that document, you can record a voice note, right? So if he''s drawing and doing his little things with his pencil on his iPad, he could record a voice note rather than like jotting all of this down like freehand. And then you guys in the office would just have to listen to his voice rather than try to read what he''s trying to put down. Yeah, almost like dictation. Absolutely. That would be great. Yeah. And I feel like he''s got to be able to do that for you guys more so than for himself. So let me ask you this. Okay, so say we do this, and I know that you said that the translation, and this is a big thing on my mind because all of our guys, we have a couple that can speak decent English, but they don''t always understand English so well. So if they''re in the field and they do a note and they do it, you know, speaking the note, and that comes across, we''re able to hear that in English? That translation works like that? No, I''m really hoping that we get to a point where like this new AI kick will allow us to start incorporating stuff like that because it''s pretty close. There''s some cool stuff happening with artificial intelligence. But right now we haven''t incorporated that or it''s not there yet from a technological standpoint. When it comes to like translation is one, there''s a couple different ways to look at this. One, we can have it to where all the hard-coded fields in our app translate to Spanish so that it''s easy for them to navigate. And then on the flip side, we''re also putting a lot of like we''re templating out a lot of things so that your guys don''t have to put in as many notes. They just have to click buttons, right? So when we build out forms or whatnot, it''s less of them having to jot notes down and more of them just saying, yes, I did this. No, this wasn''t there. So like a drop-down box. Exactly. And that''s something we put into Spanish so that it''s... Okay, so it''s put in Spanish. Okay, okay. I was going to say, okay, so if they check this box, I used four blue plumbagos and 16 foxtail ferns, and they put that in English because their numbers, it''s crazy. It''s not always in English. So as long as when we get it in the office, we''re able to see it in English and it''s correct, then that would be great. Yeah, because we have about 65 companies in Texas alone and then companies through New Mexico, Arizona, California, and we have no issue with the Spanish-English communication. Okay, that''s awesome. Awesome. Okay, that''s good. Any other questions? So this... Product communicates with QuickBooks. So how would that work? So would we still maintain QuickBooks for billing and all of that? Or is this a replacement of QuickBooks? No, it''s not a replacement. We are not an accounting system. We do everything from the start of a project to up into billing, right? So we can create invoice drafts out of Bolt. You can manage your contracts and your items, like how much we''re going to charge for this. You can basically, for your situation, build an estimate in our system. And then when it comes time to bill on that final estimate, you could push the information from Bolt to QuickBooks so you''re not doing duplicate data entry. Okay, so... Because right now there''s a lot of manual data entry on how you are doing things today. Yes, because we... And the company''s never been... It is in my short-term goal to get us to a P2P process. But right now it''s far from there. Number one, I don''t have the staff. And number two, change is hard. And pushing anything, I''ve got to have my ducks in a row when I approach it. We do... Yeah, so anyway. Okay, so the estimate... Go ahead. I think there are some really complex features in our system that we can get to in time. But what I would probably recommend is we start really basic and solve this communication piece and see if we can just make it easy for you, Kevin, and everybody else to get on the same page. Yes, yeah. And if we can accomplish that, I think that''s a massive benefit to the company. All the other stuff, we can address in implementation as you guys get more comfortable with the system itself. Okay, so let me back up for just a second so I understand. So the estimate process, Kevin has his tablet or whatever. Is it a tablet or is it just his phone? It could be a tablet or a phone. I would probably recommend a tablet for the fact that he''s drawing. Just give him more real estate to work with. But if he has a phone, we can make that work. Okay, so he has his device. He goes to the customer. So we put the customer database into... Or is he actually signing on to Bolt, which is tied to QuickBooks and our customer information is feeding across from there? Or how does the customer information get... Let me back up. My brain is getting ahead of my mouth. No, you''re good. I know where you''re going, and I can explain it to you, but it''s going to be a lot easier to look at it from a visual perspective. Okay. And I think I''m confident that we can help you guys out at this based on everything you told me, your process, the challenges within your process. I think it would be best to schedule out a demo. Okay. My teammate Chrissy is our product expert. She demos Bolt. My job is just to make sure all your questions get answered and kind of just manage this process that we''re in. But the next step from here would be to schedule out that demo so you can take a look at it. I would probably say just keep it to you for now. Okay. If you like what you see, you think it''s something that could work for the team, let''s schedule out a second demo with the rest of the team once you''re confident. Okay, yeah. What do you think? Yeah, that sounds great. I think there''d be mass confusion if we did it any other way. Cool. And then you can also, like, if you like it, you can also guide us and be like, okay, let''s maybe not get too deep on this process. Let''s focus more on this thing when we talk with Kevin, stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Cool. So I am out of town next week for that vacation. Okay. Would you be okay scheduling something for, like, the first week of June? Yeah, that''s perfectly fine. Next week is actually month-end for me, so not just month-end, quarter-end, month-end. So I''ll be kind of busy next week anyway. Okay. What day would work best for you that week? Let me see. Hang on one second. Okay. I''ll tell you what, because that first week of June is a payroll week for me, can we do it the week of the 9th? Like that Tuesday the 10th would be okay. Okay. I''m going to make a note to give you a shout that Monday just to make sure nothing has come up crazy. Okay. But let''s go ahead and put something tentative on for that Tuesday. What time specifically would work best for you? If we could do around two, the afternoons seem to be a little bit better for me than the mornings. Chrissy, you have a dentist appointment at 2.30? Can we do one o''clock? Yeah, one will be fine. One will be great. All right. I will get that demo sent out, and then I''ll get Chrissy notes from this conversation so that she''s fully prepped up to address a lot of what we talked about, and we''ll just kind of go from there. Okay, awesome. Tim, thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing what you guys got. Yeah, I appreciate all the information. I love how you walked me through your company and just all the details of it. It''s awesome. Yeah, and that''s just high level. Wait till you really see it. Trust me. You guys are an incredibly complex organization, but I work with landscapers all the time. Okay, well, that''s great to know. I''ll be honest. You are my second favorite trade to work with. Oh, wow. Okay, awesome. Plumbing is my favorite. Really? Yeah. Wow. It''s the most complex trade type out there, and just every single business is so incredibly different for the exact same kind of trade, but I''ve worked with more plumbing companies than I''ve worked with any trade at this point. Landscapers are definitely up there as well, though. Oh, gosh. Wow. Okay, well, I look forward to it, and I really thank you for your time and your knowledge and expertise and listening. For sure. Yeah, I mean, that''s the only way this thing works, right? Right, right. There''s a lot of BS software out there, and we''re just trying to make sure that we don''t rope anybody around. Right. Well, let me ask you just a ballpark high-level question. Go in the direction that we were talking, just getting us to where the mass confusion is less confusion. Ballpark average, what does this run roughly? How many total employees do you have? That would be using the program or company-wide? We''ll probably have a better idea of who''s going to use the program once we get to the demo. You''ll have a much better idea of who needs to have access to it, but how many people in office do you guys have? Altogether, we probably have about 40. 40 total employees? Yeah. And then do you subcontract any work? It''s kind of seasonal, so in the wintertime we may have less because, again, all of our lawn and landscape, I don''t want to say all, but 22 of them are H-2A visa workers, so they all go home in November. So, yeah, but during peak season, February to October, November, we''re running about 40. Okay. I''d say we''d probably be in the ballpark of $1,000 to $1,500 a month with that user count. It could be more, it could be less. Again, you''ll have a much better idea of how many people need to have access to the system once you get an idea of how everything functions, but my recommendation is you definitely want everybody in the office to have access to the system. Any field supervisors, Kevin for sure, and then typically your crew leads will have access so that you have somebody that''s able to clock crews in, take pictures, stuff like that. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that''s still going to be a pretty good number, but yeah, we can definitely look at that. I mean, obviously later, but that''s a good ballpark to have because he''ll ask, you know, so I can at least say roughly, you know, given certain dynamics or whatever, this is apt to change. Yeah, and just so you know, all of our pricing is based on users. There''s a flat fee for the software system, and then there''s a user fee, and then we do have an implementation and training fee, and there''s three different packages you guys can choose from on that front. Oh, okay, okay. Okay, well, perfect, perfect. All right, well, I look forward to the demo. Awesome. I''m looking forward to just seeing if we can help you guys out and everything. Awesome. All right, Tim, well, you enjoy your vacation and the holiday, and congratulations to you and your wife. I appreciate it. Enjoy your weekend, all right? You too. All right, bye-bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
This conversation between Tim from Bolt Software and Sabrina from Southern Lawn and Landscape focused on exploring whether Bolt''s software solution could address communication and process inefficiencies in Sabrina''s landscaping business. Tim provided an overview of the software''s capabilities, while Sabrina detailed her company''s operations, challenges, and goals. They agreed to schedule a demo to evaluate the software further.

**Key Points:**  
• **Overview of Bolt Software:**  
  Tim explained that Bolt is designed for trade contractors, centralizing project management, scheduling, and communication. It integrates with QuickBooks, supports mobile app usage, and offers features like real-time updates, document management, and Spanish-language support for field crews.  

• **Southern Lawn and Landscape''s Current Challenges:**  
  Sabrina outlined inefficiencies in communication, scheduling, and documentation. Key issues include reliance on manual processes (e.g., whiteboards, paper notes), language barriers with field crews, and inconsistent communication of changes between the office, field, and customers.  

• **Next Steps and Pricing:**  
  They agreed to schedule a demo for the week of June 9 to evaluate the software''s fit for their needs. Tim provided a rough pricing estimate of $1,000–$1,500 per month, based on user count, and explained that implementation and training fees would vary depending on the chosen package.', NULL, '{"overallScore":85,"criteria":{"talkTimeRatio":60,"objectionHandling":8,"discoveryQuestions":25,"valueArticulation":9,"activeListening":9,"nextSteps":true,"rapport":10},"strengths":["Built strong rapport with the prospect early in the call.","Thoroughly explored the prospect''s current processes and pain points.","Clearly articulated the value of the software in addressing specific challenges."],"improvements":["Could have provided a more concise explanation of the software''s capabilities.","Missed an opportunity to address the prospect''s concerns about team adoption more directly.","Could have clarified pricing structure earlier to avoid potential confusion."],"actionItems":["Prepare a tailored demo focusing on communication and scheduling improvements.","Follow up with the prospect to confirm the demo date and time closer to the scheduled date.","Ensure the demo includes specific examples of how the software can integrate with QuickBooks and handle language barriers."],"summary":"The sales call was effective in building rapport and uncovering the prospect''s pain points, particularly around communication and scheduling inefficiencies.

Hey, good morning. This is Abraham over at Eastside calling for Ian. Hi, this is Ian speaking. Hey, Ian. How''s it going, man? How was your weekend? Good. How was yours? Pretty good, man. A little too short, to be honest, though. Yeah, I hear you. But hey, I''m just checking in here with the team at Jobbox Square. I know that you were kind of looking into our shop management system last year, and things just kind of didn''t move forward. I was looking at the notes. I think it was kind of like either you didn''t have an actual project or maybe just didn''t have a budget. So it''s been a while, man, so I just thought it''d be a good idea to check in, see whether you landed on something different or how you were doing now. We''re good right now, but I don''t think that program works for us. Okay. What was the last thing? Sorry, I couldn''t hear. I said we''re too small to be able to utilize it effectively. Okay, I see. And when you say too small, do you mean like what exactly do you mean by that? So tell me, what was it you were offering again? It was a management tool? Yeah, I guess the technical fancy term is like an ERP, and it''s kind of like a quote-to-cash system made for small manufacturers. And that''s why I asked what you mean by small, because this is made specifically for small shops, job shops, fab shops, et cetera. What kind of cash are we talking about? I''m sorry, say that again? I said what kind of cost are we talking about for your system? So I wish I could answer with kind of more clarity, because I''m not kind of like the expert that kind of gets the pricing. But there''s three different tiers, and they kind of come down to like how many users you would need and stuff like that. And they go anywhere from like I''ve seen deals anywhere from two all the way up to five figures. So it just kind of depends on different things. Yeah, that''s fairly typical for ERP systems. But yeah, we are too small. There''s only three of us in here. So it would be way overkill for us. Okay. And do you think that, again, just to give you a little more context, like I''ll give you an example of someone that thought they were too small and might be smaller than you. We actually have a one-man shop. It''s not even a shop. It''s like I work in out of his garage. I use this system. The system''s called Jobbox Square. Again, just to give you an idea, you might be right. It might be too small. It''s kind of impossible for me to know, and that''s kind of why I asked, like what do you mean by too small? And what are you guys currently using now to kind of just keep track of everything? QuickBooks. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that''s kind of what like 50% of our customers use. And QuickBooks is kind of like one of our partners. So a lot of them continue using QuickBooks. It just kind of integrates with Jobbox Square, with the ERP, and they just kind of go from there. So I''m kind of – I guess my question is do you feel that if like budget wasn''t a concern, like this could be something that, you know, you would want to look into? I just cannot see an application for it for us. You see it as what for you? I do not see it as an application for us. Okay. And why not? It''s based on my experience with ERP systems. Okay. And have you used Jobbox Square specifically or other ERPs? Just other ERPs. Okay. So I know I''m asking you a lot of questions, man. And the reason why is this is just kind of what we do. Like we – I''ve seen the impact that our system has. A lot of the customers that I''ve kind of helped brought in, we''ve had the same conversation. Like I think we''re just small, Abraham. Like I don''t think – I don''t know if this necessarily applies for what we do, et cetera, et cetera. So that''s kind of why I''m so curious because I see the impact that the system is making for our customers. I see that it''s helping them. It''s helping them grow. And honestly, a lot of them would even tell you that the reason why they felt that they were too small in the first place is because they weren''t using something that could kind of help streamline their growth. So, I mean, all that being said, man, it''s like because I can''t answer the questions about the pricing that well for you, I know that Holly, who''s like our expert in California, I know that she would be more than happy to have a quick conversation with you. This isn''t a, hey, let''s try to get Ian to buy the system today. It''s more of a is this something that would be helpful for him, number one? Are they really too small? Is there no need for this? And, you know, if the answer for those is like, yeah, there''s no need, this is not something that they could use, we''re not going to try to kind of move forward, let alone try to sell this to you. But we''ll try to point you in the right direction if there''s anything, like any recommendations we can make. But you never know. It might actually be something that could work for you right now as it is. I know Holly would be really happy. She loves having conversations with people just like you and kind of determining that. I mean, it''s up to you whether you''d like to take 10 minutes, 15 minutes to connect with her. If you would, I''d be more than happy to make that happen for you. There''s no harm in talking. Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, man. And also Holly, she''s been with this company for like 100 years, about 30 to be more exact. And so she knows a thing or two not just about our system, but also other systems, manufacturing, et cetera, et cetera. So let me pull up her calendar and see if I can find you guys a time that works for both of you. I think she''s pretty busy the next, like she''s pretty busy tomorrow. Thursday, Friday, she has a little bit more time. For either of those days, for either Thursday or Friday, would there be a time that you think would work for you? Yeah, around this time on Thursday. Sorry, man, say that again? I say around this time on Thursday. I''m so sorry. I couldn''t catch that. I say around 11 a.m. on Thursday. Okay, okay. 11 a.m. on Thursday. Let me see. Okay, so I think that she is free that time. Let me just put in the calendar and make sure. All right, yeah, it looks like she is open at that time. Let me just ping her just to double check. I think she has meetings scheduled around that. So let me just see if I can confirm that with her. But I think she is good for that day. And what she will be doing is she will just give you a phone call. Again, just introduce herself and kind of ask you the important questions and see if we would be a good fit as partners or not. And then based on that, she can kind of tell you, hey, I think it''s better we just kind of shake hands and part our separate ways. Or if we are a good fit, then she''ll kind of tell you what the next steps would be. So, yeah, so she just replied to me, and she is good for Thursday, 11 a.m. Pacific time. So I''m going to send you an e-mail invite. Just do me a favor when you get it, just click accept so that it goes in your calendar and then Holly knows that you will be there. Let me make sure I got your right e-mail, Ian. Is it idober at sw-industrial.com? Yep, that''s it. All right, perfect. All right, so I''ll send that to you within the next few minutes. And, yeah, I know, like I said, I know Holly is more than excited to chat with you, man, and I hope that we are a good fit. But even if we''re not, I really hope that she can try to provide some value for you. All right, appreciate the call. You got it, brother. We''ll talk to you in a couple days. All right. All right, bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Abraham from Eastside contacted Ian at Southwest to follow up on a shop management system called Jobbox Square. Ian expressed concerns that his small team of three might not benefit from an ERP system, but Abraham suggested a call with a product expert, Holly, to explore whether the system could be a good fit. They scheduled a meeting for Thursday at 11 a.m. Pacific time.

**Key Points:**  
• **Follow-Up on ERP System:** Abraham reached out to Ian to revisit interest in Jobbox Square, a shop management ERP system designed for small manufacturers. Ian initially expressed doubts about its applicability due to his team''s size.  

• **Discussion of Concerns:** Ian mentioned that his team currently uses QuickBooks and felt an ERP system might be overkill. Abraham explained that Jobbox Square integrates with QuickBooks and shared examples of smaller teams benefiting from the system.  

• **Scheduled Meeting with Expert:** To address Ian''s concerns, Abraham arranged a call with Holly, an experienced product expert, for Thursday at 11 a.m. Pacific time.

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you?

I''m good, how are you?

I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment.

About what?

Job Boss Squared.

Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah.

Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was.

Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabey, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions, so I''ll just let you go ahead. Where were you going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question, but essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and ideally I look at, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshcut or Semcut Send. A lot of their work comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends, and then they can order, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, you all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works a lot of the shops out there, and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs, and I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said, so very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here, and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

I know some people are kind of interested in getting to like the e-commerce side as well just because everybody loves to shop online now, so we do have that street lighting over here as well if that''s ever an interest. What about rental? Does it integrate with rental, total rental? Because we have a rental store here as well. Just to add another little element to it. I will double check on that. I will literally double check as soon as we get off that phone. Not 100% sure, so I don''t want to tell you something and then be incorrect, but I can find out and then send an email over to you kind of with the information about Spruce, all that type of stuff.

Hi there, it is Lesleyan. Speaking. Hi, Lesley, this is Ryan Cannon over at ECI. How are you doing today? I''m fine. I had received your email this morning, a reply to some information on Bolt that I had sent you. You said you might be available for Friday, and I just wanted to reach out and see what your availability looked like. Exactly what is Bolt? So Bolt is a project management tool for contractors that are working primarily with builders. Are you guys doing new residential construction with builders? We are, but we use their software. And when you say their software, you''re referring to their builder portals? Yes. So we actually manage one of the builder portals, the ITK. I''m not sure if you''re familiar with that one. Yes, I am with Christopher Companies. Awesome. So we''re ECI. That''s our builder portal. We work with trade contractors like yourself. We also have a tool called Bolt, and that tool Bolt, it takes those jobs out of those portals and puts them all into one place. So what we''ve created is a tool that takes all those jobs from every portal, puts them all into one portal, and it manages the day-to-day as far as scheduling crews, everything from inventory to estimating, but everything just goes into one system. It''s kind of hard to explain over a phone call, but we do have about 2,000 crews nationwide using it. And I got your e-mail this morning, and I was just calling to see if you''d be open to a 10-minute call this Friday to hear a little more about it. The main person that you really need to sell this to is my boss, and he''s tighter than a tree on a bark, bark on a tree. And we don''t really have that many projects that, one, are linked into ECI. The only one we have is Christopher Companies. And as far as calling up saying, I need your crew here, that varies from job to job, and it relies on the project manager to make that phone call to say, I need your guys here tomorrow instead of next week. Right. So the Bolt portal, not a portal rather, but the project management tool, it will take, you know, if you guys are logging into Hyphen, SupplyPro, Buildersuite, those other portals as well, it won''t just do the ITK portal. It will take all your jobs and centralize them. Yeah, we don''t use any of those. Any of those? Nope, none. What''s your guys'' volume looking like? Are you doing over 300 or 400 homes a year? No. No? Well, it varies. This coming year we''ve got some projects that are wrapping up, especially with Envy Homes, and they''re waiting to get some sites opened and completed to start construction again. So, you know, they''ve got their own portal, their own scheduling that we follow on a weekly basis. Okay. Well, I will say Bolt is more so designed if you''re doing high volume. Right now if you''re doing under 300 homes a year, it might not make sense. When it gets, you know, hard to manage all of these jobs, you know, obviously when you''re doing a ton of volume, you''re moving your guys around constantly, just shifting things, but I would still love to show it to you sometime. Like I said, it''s kind of hard to explain over the phone, but once you see what we have, it''s a system that''s designed for people that do nothing but new residential. It was designed. And see, we just don''t do new residential. Oh, you don''t? And mostly what we provide is labor, no job materials. Right, so you guys are the actual contractor that goes out, and are you guys doing electrical work? What kind of, what''s your trade? Foundations and framing. Foundations and framing. Okay. I mean, that''s exactly what the tool is for, not materials, but the work itself. So we work with, it was actually designed by an electrician, so we work with a lot of electricians, concrete guys, drywall, any trades that are going out, working with builders, they''re doing kind of production homes. Are you guys doing more so custom or a lot of track homes? We''re doing the production homes, and, like, right now we''ve got two starts for this week for NV, and then we don''t have any starts for three weeks. Okay, a little slower right now. It is slow right now. Okay. Well, you guys are probably just doing fine on spreadsheets and, you know, on paper right now. I think down the road, if you''re ever looking, you know, you guys start picking up more work, and it becomes a little hectic, I would love to show you Bolt, because it really organizes everything. All the jobs go into one place, and when you''re doing, you know, 10, 15 homes a week, like some of our guys are, you know, 500-plus a year, then it can be a lot to manage. You''re bouncing in and out of different portals. You''ve got jobs all over the place, and that''s when you start not getting paid for extras. You know, job sites are not ready. You''re constantly going out to, and we can eliminate all of that within our Bolt project management tool. I think it has slowed up exponentially because of interest rates. I think people have finally gotten a little weary of getting that, because we''re in a resort area, and I truly believe that people are not buying that second home right now. A hundred percent. I agree with you completely. But I might just – well, I''ve already sent you an e-mail. I''ll send you a little bit of information, but you''ve already seen, you know, my e-mail. I might just follow up with you maybe next year, see where you guys are at. We''d love to show it to you sometime. I think most companies are kind of leaning towards a software when they''re getting into, you know, high volume, but right now you guys are probably doing just fine on – Yeah, no, we''re – I mean, yeah, even with dealing with two national builders, we don''t have the volume of starts right now. Okay. Well, I hope you guys are able to pick up soon, but I appreciate your time, Leslie. You have a good day. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Okay. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**
Lesleyan from Atlantic Building Associates spoke with Ryan Cannon from ECI regarding the Bolt project management tool designed for contractors. They discussed the suitability of Bolt for Lesleyan''s company, which primarily handles production homes but currently has a lower volume of projects.

**Key Points:**
• **Introduction to Bolt:** Ryan explained that Bolt is a project management tool that centralizes job management for contractors, integrating various builder portals into one system for better scheduling and inventory management.

• **Current Operations:** Lesleyan clarified that their company primarily manages production homes and does not utilize multiple builder portals, which may limit the immediate applicability of Bolt for their current operations.

• **Future Considerations:** Ryan acknowledged that Bolt is more beneficial for high-volume operations and suggested following up in the future when Lesleyan''s company might have a greater need for such a tool, especially as market conditions change.', NULL, '{"overallScore":65,"criteria":{"talkTimeRatio":70,"objectionHandling":6,"discoveryQuestions":8,"valueArticulation":7,"activeListening":8,"nextSteps":false,"rapport":7},"strengths":["Good discovery questions","Effective objection handling","Maintained rapport"],"improvements":["Articulate value more clearly","Establish next steps","Address customer needs more directly"],"actionItems":["Follow up with additional information","Schedule a future check-in","Research customer needs further"],"summary":"The sales call demonstrated good rapport and effective discovery questions, but struggled with articulating the value of the product for the customer''s specific needs and did not establish clear next steps."}', '2025-10-01 21:33:18.06+00', NULL, '{"summary": "The sales call demonstrated good rapport and effective discovery questions, but struggled with articulating the value of the product for the customer''s specific needs and did not establish clear next steps.", "criteria": {"rapport": 7, "nextSteps": false, "talkTimeRatio": 70, "activeListening": 8, "objectionHandling": 6, "valueArticulation": 7, "discoveryQuestions": 8}, "strengths": ["Good discovery questions", "Effective objection handling", "Maintained rapport"], "actionItems": ["Follow up with additional information", "Schedule a future check-in", "Research customer needs further"], "bdrInsights": {"keyStrengths": ["Clear communication", "Good rapport building"], "nextCallFocus": ["Ask more open-ended questions", "Work on assertiveness"], "competencyLevel": "needs improvement", "improvementAreas": ["Need to improve closing techniques", "Talk time balance needs attention"], "coachingPriorities": ["Focus on objection handling", "Enhance business acumen"]}, "improvements": ["Articulate value more clearly", "Establish next steps", "Address customer needs more directly"], "overallScore": 65, "bdrEvaluationId": "06c26bf0-69e3-4815-9c3d-171411758c78", "bdrCriteriaScores": {"closing": {"score": 1, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Did not summarize prospect needs or attempt a strong close.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Summarize key points before closing", "Use an assumptive close technique"]}, "opening": {"score": 1.864, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Standard introduction with a weak pattern interrupt attempt.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Incorporate a stronger pattern interrupt", "Practice a more confident delivery"]}, "talkTime": {"score": 1, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Rep dominated the conversation, speaking too much.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Aim for a better balance in talk time", "Encourage more prospect input"]}, "qualification": {"score": 1.864, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Basic qualification questions asked, but lacked depth.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Use more open-ended questions", "Explore pain points more thoroughly"]}, "toneAndEnergy": {"score": 1.864, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Tone was generally positive but lacked energy.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Work on varying tone and pacing", "Practice maintaining an energetic delivery"]}, "businessAcumen": {"score": 1, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Minimal business context provided, lacking specific insights.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Research industry trends", "Incorporate relevant case studies"]}, "objectionHandling": {"score": 1.864, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Acknowledged objections but did not effectively reframe the conversation.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Practice reframing objections", "Maintain curiosity about the prospect''s needs"]}, "assertivenessAndControl": {"score": 1.864, "weight": 12.5, "feedback": "Some control over the conversation, but lacked urgency.", "maxScore": 4, "suggestions": ["Practice guiding the conversation more assertively", "Create a sense of urgency in discussions"]}}, "bdrTrainingProgramId": "03f558d4-dfb2-4ea3-ae98-8ec2857acf2e"}', NULL, 'bdr_training_data', true, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'pending', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-10-01 21:32:43.85336+00', NULL, 'pending', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '{"duration_source": "ffmpeg", "partial_success": false, "summary_success": true, "coaching_success": true, "summary_rate_limited": false, "coaching_rate_limited": false, "transcription_success": true}', 100, NULL, NULL, 'Benjamin Warden', NULL, NULL, NULL),

Whether it''s for deck footings, dog kennels, sidewalks, or anything else you''d like, we''ll have it ready for you. Ask the pros at Lloyd Lumber about Cardaway Concrete. At Lloyd Lumber, there is no sorting through pallets. Corey, can I help you? Corey, this is Grace Burks from ECI Spruce. Have you heard of us before? I have. Okay, perfect. Well, then just a quick refresher. Work with businesses closely like yours to just kind of help simplify operations, kind of making this day-to-day task a little bit easier. I was just curious how you guys were tracking your sales and inventory right now. Well, we have Epicor. Epicor, okay. Eagle. Eagle with Epicor. And everything been working good for you so far with that? Okay, perfect. I do know that Epicor Eagle is kind of going end of life in 2026, so just want to have that top of mind. I know that they have some other options available. They do, yeah. BizTrack or this or that. Yeah, totally know that you guys already use them, all that, but do the same thing kind of in the lumberyard area as well. So if kind of when that time comes, we''d love to just like send over an email just so you have my information, some information about Spruce too, just so you have all the options open. Okay. Yeah, we''re actually looking at another one called Flitch. Have you ever heard of that? To be so honest with you, no. I''m pretty new, so I don''t know all of them. I actually have a meeting with him on September 9th to look at their system. So, yeah. And is that just kind of the accounting and all that aspect? Yeah. Okay. And are you looking at that one because of anything with Epicor Eagle right now, like something not working completely right? Eagle is so antiquated, you know. Yeah. It''s old, it''s clumsy, it''s not user-friendly like some of the other ones, you know. They''re more, their searches are easier the way they do them now for product searches and whatnot, and the way they gather information and the way we bring in information in from vendors and, you know, have it streamlined into, you know, POs and whatnot. Yeah, so we''re looking, but just not anything real readily something we''re going to do tomorrow, you know. Yeah, no, totally understand. Next year, the following year or whatever, but keeping my eyes open. Yeah, totally get that. No hurry, but definitely would love to be in that aspect just so you can kind of see all your options, maybe see a demo over here as well of just kind of what we do, kind of built by like lumber yards and builders, so definitely streamlines really well with kind of the PO, the accounting. I know some people are kind of interested in getting to like the e-commerce side as well just because everybody loves to shop online now, so we do have that street lighting over here as well if that''s ever an interest. What about rental? Does it integrate with rental, total rental? Because we have a rental store here as well. Just to add another little element to it. I will double check on that. I will literally double check as soon as we get off that phone. Not 100% sure, so I don''t want to tell you something and then be incorrect, but I can find out and then send an email over to you kind of with the information about Spruce, all that type of stuff. See if you''d want to maybe learn a little bit more, but can answer that question in the email as well. Just don''t want to give you something and then be wrong. Sure. Awesome. Do you have my email then? Yeah, let me double check that I have the correct one on file. I just have Corey at LloydLumberCo.com. That''s me. Okay, perfect. Then I will just send over a quick email with my information and if anything kind of sounds of interest to you, I''d love to move forward. I know it''s not an urgent thing that you guys are looking for, but just to kind of keep us in mind. Sure. Okay. Awesome. Well, I appreciate your time and hope you have a good rest of your day. I''ll send over that email as soon as we get off. Thank you. Yeah, of course. You have a good one. Bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hi John? Yes. Hey John, this is Jordan over at DECOM. How''s your morning going so far? I''m doing well, thank you. I''m glad to hear it. I apologize for the random call. I was giving you a ring because I know you and I believe Holly, I''m unsure of her last name at the moment, but you guys had looked into software, you guys were running a project, I think the timing wasn''t right. So I just wanted to reach out and kind of see where you guys were with that, get a pulse check if you will. Gotcha, yeah, no, I mean we''re literally where we were last time. We haven''t gotten any farther with that at all to be honest. It''s been way on the back burner currently. Gotcha, that makes complete sense. To my knowledge, how''d you guys even consider it in the first place? To be honest, I can''t remember. I mean, to be honest, like I said, we''re looking for ERPs and I mean that''s what the talk is, but yeah, right now it''s still just in the early development stage. I mean, we haven''t, we''re just looking for some kind of system. We don''t even know what we want to look for yet, but it''s, yeah, it''s way on the back burner currently. That makes complete sense. Are you guys still using, I see my notes here, you guys are using QuickBooks? Is that still the case now? Yeah, yeah. And is that something down the line that you guys are looking to get rid of or you kind of wanting to stay with that or? We, it doesn''t necessarily matter to us. I mean, it''s been serving us fine currently, but again, we''re just looking for to upgrade our entire systems depending on, but we have specialized software, so it just depends on that aspect of it. So that makes complete sense. And do you guys have a system, a current ERP system or are you guys totally doing things kind of manual through Excel? Yeah, no, exactly. That''s what I mean. So, well, we have our, so we were using it, like I said, a very specialized program for manufacturing processes and then, like I said, it, we kind of have it paired up with QuickBooks, so that''s kind of the twist. And of course, then we just use Microsoft, the Microsoft suite of offices and stuff like that for day-to-day stuff and all that. And then our CRM is different. So again, we''re just trying to integrate things as best we can. And so that''s what, but again, we haven''t got any farther than what we have currently just because there''s too many other needs currently. So that makes complete sense. Obviously, when it''s appropriate, the time is valuable. But it definitely sounds like you guys are exactly what we help. So do you mind if I send over some information, just a little bit about what we do, maybe follow up with you in a week or so and see if it makes sense to have a conversation. We are, you know, looking more so to be that asset and a consultant. So just getting you introduced to our team, kind of showing you what we do and slowly integrating that conversation. So when you guys are ready, you know what''s out there, you know kind of what you''re looking for, you have the information. Because I''m sure, as you''re aware, there''s a ton of information out there. Sure. There''s a ton of people calling you guys too. So we just want to be able to sit down with you guys and just have an introduction, kind of see what you guys do, what we do, that whole thing. Yeah, no, that''d be fine. Yeah, please feel free to send that information. I''m happy to take a look at it. Awesome. I''m happy to. And with that, I know obviously, like I said, there''s a ton of information that gets sent to you. There''s a ton of information to just read and see. Is there anything in particular, just off at the top of your head, that you guys are like, oh, this is, there''s got to be a better way to do this or that''s just been a headache for you guys over the past year? I mean, it''s really just integrating between, like I said, our specialized software that we have, I mean, that we can''t get away from. So I mean, that''s, so it has to be able to be compatible with that. So that''s what we''re, right now, like I said, we''re able to use for the accounting software, at least QuickBooks. With that, and then the CRM we''re currently using, we''re using Monday.com that we just recently switched to this last year from Salesforce, because Salesforce was just too, it wasn''t very cumbersome. This Monday has been very good for us. So again, we''re slowly integrating different things and we''re just trying to see how best we can integrate between the software, so that way we don''t always have to keep duplicating things if we can avoid it. Of course, and that makes complete sense. Obviously, that duplication takes up a ton of time, I''m sure. So, sweet. Okay, yeah, I''ll send over some stuff, maybe follow up with you later in the week, and then hopefully try to schedule something to see, you know, just introduce you to my team, some of the, some of the experts, as far as your field goes, and then we can go from there. Well, awesome. Well, I appreciate it, John. I know I called you out of the blue here, so I appreciate the five minutes. No problem. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Of course. Thank you.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, Justin. This is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good. How are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. It looked like you might have been doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center. And we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s. And that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird. It''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. OK. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So I mean, we have all this stuff. And we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff. And we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. OK. Yeah. That''s OK. That''s kind of where we step in. And we help with the educational piece. And through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you, or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. OK. That''s great. OK. So yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you. Go ahead. Where were you going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand. Is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew. But it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine. Stuff where I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything. Just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe. And that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business. Actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question. But it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer. And then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us. But I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Exactly. Yeah. And ideally, I look at, if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends. And then they can add other processes to their order. So they have a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. Because the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus it first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call the bomb, the bill of materials. And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works. But that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing. Because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. OK. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. OK. OK. And what''s the cost basis for Jobshop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers. But just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to mid-sized shops. So it''s kind of more in that starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level? And what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about, because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. OK. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in? Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, you all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, it''s San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there. And she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. I don''t know. She might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had one, and he introduced me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly, and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. OK. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. OK. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here, and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. OK. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. OK.

I know you there''s several people invited I''ll just let you you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off Okay, I''m not sure Who all is available on our end? Robert thanks for hopping on.

So Thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call evolution X It''s uh, you guys have been going down this path a little bit trying to work with a Vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already. That''s fully vetted Everything that you''re looking to have in the solution. I think we have for you guys. So We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you Jace EJ''s on the phone CJ comes from evolution X. I''m your account manager from the automate standpoint. I''m from just be, Missouri Been doing this 39 years. So happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well But anyway, CJ is going to kind of go over the product in a little high-level Please ask questions This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward So with that I''m gonna turn over to you CJ Yeah, so Chrissy Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team Really extensively last year and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo but would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on evolution X like who we are or How we work any of that type of stuff or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just The cliff notes, I mean, I''ll give you 30,000 if you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So evolution X e-commerce is a b2b e-commerce software It''s been around about 17 years And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago and it was just because they had enough Customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that see I build an integration if it just made sense for them to buy us and so Now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates Division and customer base and so we''ve had several customers I don''t know throughout the last six months beginning to onboard and it''s been a lot of fun So just think of this as a robust b2b e-commerce software that would compete with any big-box player out there but we''re bringing it to the Small medium-sized distributor within the ECI family awesome I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this So this demos for you guys stop me anywhere we can pivot I''m definitely gonna be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform But this is the flow that I''m gonna go through I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like we''ll give you a back-end overview and I''ll make a change on the home page of my website So you can see like what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage? some search functionality Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded You''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results Some marketing tools and then I will log in as a customer at the end So you can get a feel for what that''s gonna look like for your customers Okay So I pulled a few customer examples here Is that? Yes, sorry Okay, sorry misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here We design these in-house for you guys So the way this would work if you decide to go with evolution X Our design team consults with you and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do No custom design. We can go a few different routes and I''ve pulled examples of each. So this is a fully custom home page For a dealer that''s in the office supply space they also sell some Technology and other products as well But I think from a design perspective we can make this look any way you want it to look some people have a vision for What this drop-down might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side a Lot of different ways we can look to go about this But I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology any category of products They should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for So in this instance, you know, we''ll just go to printers You If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees we can have as many or as few of these as you want But again, ideally these customers are gonna be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website What if they? Excuse me. What if they have a skew and know? Exactly The product that they''re yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable 100% so that''s where some of the search capability will come into play where if you want them to be able to search by the product number reference number That can be done any way you guys want Well, we''ll have full flexibility over the search bar Okay, so it can even like index the description for I put in you know, Dell 14-inch 256 gig it''s gonna go Hey, there''s five results that have those words in the description. Okay? Yeah, it would pull up in the description the category the attributes whatever fields we need to pull it from. Absolutely So I''ll death I''ll look to show you a few different ways. We could leverage the search bar But that''s certainly one of them now looking at Less custom design this website one of our out-of-the-box themes So at a base level we have some templates or themes We call them that we can spin up and essentially we would put your color scheme your branding your logo We would put media in here from you guys or we can supply it But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like If you want to have a shop by brand Banner running across the site So Anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has unique design CJ just a quick question going back to the search searching functionality One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example It doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description Did I hear you say that Evo X actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely keywords attributes So you can go back on any given product and there''s a field where you can say We call it keywords But if you type in a keyword and associated with that product, it means that line of products will pop up Whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it Okay, and this I think is important to note I Say that we''re a white glove service, but it''s your arm and arm is probably the more accurate way to say it You''re gonna have a really good customer success team helping you build this website a lot of this is We''re gonna train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future We don''t want to stand in your way, but if you do want help with these things You''ll have live chat support from us You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to and search the way you want so But ideally we''re gonna help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live that way The search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little sub menus would pop up so Just giving you a feel for from possibilities I think we can design anything you guys would want but this will be something to think about Jeff and all of you as we go down this road if you do want customization We''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team that way they can make Recommendations and hear what you''re looking for and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. So Now something way less glamorous is my demo store I designed this so don''t judge me And I wouldn''t be the one designing your website But I''ll use this just to navigate and move some stuff around and go through the demo Let me see I''m actually gonna log out of my user and I''ll log back into him in a second Okay Back into the website. So when you guys log in this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective You''ll have access to some basic API and data reports. It''s it''s surface level there''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you but At surface level see order conversions how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly weekly basis You can drag and drop them with any of this around Chat support again We do chat support US and UK hours So it''s not quite 24-7, but it''s close and these are actual solutions experts Not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem So if you have an issue you can chat our team I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me and they can grab your screen send you articles jump on a call This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform If you see a new button somewhere, this is the new feature. We''ve added we add features monthly We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that And I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool So most Dealers would have us I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform and we can still do that if you want But it can be overkill for a lot of people so we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into evolution X so you can come in here and See how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at who''s the top users You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website how it''s trending And I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant Search results So this will be again Giving you data on when people come to your site. What keywords are they actually typing into the search bar? You might have something that is in your top ten It''s unexpected Well when someone types that in you''re gonna want to make sure that the right products are popping up as we''ve discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything? We''ve shown at this point? Are you able to slice those? Oh, sorry Yeah, I was gonna say are you able to slice those? Analytics down to like a from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day Yep up here. Okay. Yeah, and you can make it a custom range if you if you awesome So That''s good. What else Jeff? Did you have a question? Yeah from the design perspective. I''m curious of your approach is From our perspective. Do we create like a wireframe and give that to you guys? So you kind of know what to go from or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times your designers? Put together some options and then we you know, go through the approval process and editing process. Yeah, it can go either way I don''t think it hurts to have a wireframe But you don''t need one and our team is definitely not accustomed to having one so see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it then Certainly that helps but most people don''t Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you and then we do go through an iterative process So we''ll make a draft Based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting and then we might have to revise it three or four times Okay So no standard practice But what I''ll show you next the Jefferson is once we build you this site You''re gonna have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes. And so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I Use this jump to button in the top left just because it''s quicker to get around I''m gonna type in layouts So after the site is built this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website I''m gonna go into the home page So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform, but you don''t have to most of this is meant to be drag-and-drop no code and So we house all of the media content in these tiles that we call widgets For example, I have a media gallery tile if I open it up I have an image of this, you know office room if I go to And let me log out of this user if I go to the home page of my website and scroll down That image is right here on my website. So I just uploaded this from my desktop Into this widget. I don''t need to know code Now if I didn''t want to take it and say resize it or I wanted to switch it to the other side of the website You can kind of see all these boxes moving around in a very drag-and-drop format So this is kind of the general concept of moving stuff around what it looks like all that good stuff Now what I am gonna do On my website I have Some items for sale we call this an item merchandiser and it says new products Maybe it''s the end of the month You''ve got a sale going on and you want to highlight that and make it the first thing people see when they go to your website I Would come into this item merchandising widget and open it up I''ll change the title to end of month Specials if you want different living breathing list of product groups in here, you can have them If you want to change how fast the carousel is running you can make it, you know, two seconds versus three seconds But I''ll just save my changes and I''ll take this up to the top of my website Resize it save and publish Cool now if I go back to my website and hit refresh that''s gonna be a real-time change So now you''ll see the end of month specials carousel Hitting my website And I could probably do that in less than a minute if I wasn''t talking So Jeff would that mainly be you or would Yeah, most likely I''ll be the one administering the site perfect so Any questions about what it looks like to make a look and feel change or just any design oriented stuff from that perspective? from the rest of the team now flexibility and options Yeah, CJ one of the things that I do recall from a previous demo was how how you showcase How we could feature specific brands or specific products. So for example right now We''re we''re kind of doing a special on Dyna book, right? So yeah for the recording for the folks that couldn''t be with us Would you mind just talking about how we can highlight? Certain brains or certain products and then run specials on those products And then I remember even saying you could connect to the product listing to like a blog article on on such a product So would you mind just explaining to the team, please? Absolutely. So a few different ways you can leverage the search results from maximizing brands or categories of products The first point being if you wanted them to search a part number skew reference number you could do it that way Another example, my demo store is set up to where if I type in copy paper And I know this is an office supplies example, but you''ll get the point. I Type in coffee paper copy paper. I have my evolution X copy paper showing up first. This is ambitious margins I''m shooting for three hundred fifty dollars, but you get the point and I''ve got a banner displaying that Hey 45% off right and so that''s the general idea now the way we set this is pretty straightforward on The back end. There''s a feature called brand priority Again our team will help you guys set this up before for the site goes live So you won''t be alone and figuring this out But all I do is come in here and choose the brand that I''m looking to influence. I''ll just do 3m And I could say I want 3m to be number one or number ten Maybe you hate them and you want to bury them in the search results We''ll say we want them to be number one. And then you would just open up what catalog we''re pulling from. I think it''s important to note we have a Good amount of catalogs built into evolution X So if you''re an approved vendor with distributor network or a TD Cinex or Ingram We can spin those up and then you would just go Select The catalog and I''ll say technology warranties I want 3m to be the number one brand that pops up for this category And so that''s one way you can influence brands. It''s pretty straightforward Another would be Just see if I type in coffee maker I Have a Media banner displaying above products. So yes, I typed in copy maker It''s pulling up all the copy makers, but I have a bun copy banner displaying about the products So if somebody clicked that it would take me directly to those products. There''s another way you can Go about Influencing the search results or the cut the customer journey as well You could get I want to see if I have this let me see stapler I was gonna say maybe staplers I''ve seen some people do it where Maybe it''s not a brand but it''s a category like in this like if I typed in staplers Maybe it pulls up desktop staplers instead of I Don''t know like a heavy-duty stapler, so it may not be a brand maybe it''s a category you want showing up first But Jeff to your point what we see people doing More and more is called guided selling and so I think in your industry We see this being valuable just from educating the customer on how to buy your products So this is a furniture example But you''ll get the point of how this could relate to what you''re wanting to do If I''m on this customer''s website codex, and I''m looking for desk options I can get to the products But it also has this block above the products that will educate me on how to select the best office desk How to make sure it''s the correct height how to choose the right size and to Jeff''s point you''ll notice that throughout this blog links to cross-sell items that would be compatible with an office desk so you can go big or small with this type of concept, but essentially Guiding the customer towards purchasing a certain products, and then when I click office desks. It''s giving me the same type of experience But eventually I can actually get to the product that I''m looking for What questions y''all have looking at that You So I love that for the new customers the people that are new and fresh to the site Honestly though also we will have customers where there''s an expectation of consistent repeat business One of the customers for example that we''re trying to set this up for Does have an e-commerce spend on? Technology hardware in the seven-figure range so For them we want to make it a very convenient user experience can we talk just a little bit about how we could set up like favorites and reorders and kind of making that convenient for like Purchases for people that are kind of reordering the same things or bundles, and if they can be on a per customer absolutely So what I''m about to show you you guys will be able to do On the back end. I''m gonna go pull up some made-up accounts that I have so theoretically This would be the accounts that are on here if you want certain people in your company to only have access to certain accounts That''s very doable But I have CJ''s Furniture Co is a made-up account before I log in just to show you you''ll have some data at the the Organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history You can track their spent and the trajectory of that their search history the top users all of that stuff But I''ll go log as a user here So I have myself made up as an account and I''m gonna go log in on my profile So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do and I''m showing you right now you could do that You can target promotions to people specifically Just to take a step back I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer so This is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion Based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The home page of your website could look totally different as well But when your customers log in this is the portal experience that they''re gonna have on your website There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do but you can put their logo Or may log in instead of your logo. Theirs is gonna show up at the top of the website Obviously their user profile you can put their headshot They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history They could quickly just click view Get into a recent order in it email it or just click reorder all and all those items will be added to the cart So that''s one way They could do a quick reorder They have multiple saved carts, they''ll be able to view that multiple credit cards if two scenarios if They have a budget assigned to them by their boss This is where they can come in and check the status of their budget the balance remaining Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders or If they''re the person that has to approve the orders those would all filter in the orders to approve field but They''ll have access to some surface level stuff here. And then when they click their name This side menu is going to come up If you want to do rewards points you can do stuff like that like a Traditional e-commerce type of feature but a quick list would be what I think you called like a favorites list Mm-hmm. So if I was a sales rep, I can go in and build these for my customers or the customer could do it themselves But ideally if every time I have to restock the copy room I buy the same things I would just put those items on a quick list The quantities could be preset or a customer can just check a box and say add items to the cart These can be set up on recurring order if they buy the same things on the same days of every month No challenges with any of that Mm-hmm and all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process TJ quick question going back to the approver relationship Is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an an automated email to the approver? When when one of his employees Submits an order Yeah, absolutely. So this is where You will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say for example I''m a CFO and you made me a super admin user They could set this up or again you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want and so under advanced settings or approval settings And I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load Oh, there we go, so This is where they would come in and sit there There''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want and then this trigger the email to your point so if they wanted to Track by cost center. So maybe they want to track spend by department if they wanted to create budgets for specific users they could come in and do that here and if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month Anything above that''s going to acquire approval. They would save those settings Then what we do on the back end We have Email templates that can be customized and we would just associate that template with that account for that event So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens We would just tie an email template to that workflow So Does that answer the question? Yep, that does and in case you guys hear the alarms. We''re just doing our testing today So it''s not like what you know code red or anything. Okay I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it Okay. Yeah, we can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I''m gonna say it''s probably inconvenient for you Was the ice cream truck? So you''re doing a good job of got me Jeff there''s these are all the things that normally would show but I want to keep This relevant to you. So what other things are we not hit on that? You guys have questions about or want to see? If so, we have the The The capability to take credit cards through I guess the stripe platform and Then we also have the option on here to accept There for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is assuming Craig Well, are y''all using that one? I? Know One We''re currently using stripe to accept credit card payments But I think to further Chrissy''s question We''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with e automate from kind of an accounting perspective Got it. So the short answer is yes, we can in it like I''ll show you the App Store You can certainly use stripe my store is actually set up with stripe, but This is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services HubSpot is a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here, but Ideally, I don''t know Craig can probably answer your questions about net one on a separate call But if you wanted customers to obviously use net one or paid up using ACH Those are things that can be done as well, but stripe very doable Okay, Chrissy I''ll have some I get with you Chrissy on the net one side because the majority of our clients do use net one and interfaces with the automate integrates I mean and also your customer II info for using that so It''s a to me. It''s a no-brain must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate wise and get you what those percentages would be But um, yeah, let me get you in touch with them guys Okay, great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not a Hundred percent what it would look like. This is a different ERP, but Just on the customer portal and when we do integrate this to you automate there will be an invoice history tab Typically these fields are clickable when it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP so if they wanted to actually, you know hyperlink and click into that they could see it, but It will pull the invoice history on and offline orders So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still gonna pull that invoice history for them to 24 7 Okay, so that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I didn''t I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal Okay, i''m confused I actually have two questions cj one of which is is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about Do customers shoppers have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy. You said you wanted to show us how to do that To the product listing yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy you said you''re confused Yeah, can you just Recap this page that you''re on again. Yep You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect so evolution x integrates with 30 different erp systems Oh, okay. So e automate is one we work with a number of different Uh, so the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to e automate for that reason so I have a demo store that has some fake data To where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in they will have an invoice history tab So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website Yep, okay, I get it the data that looks yeah It doesn''t look exactly the same as what the automate data will look like because this is fake data just to give you an idea of what it would look like they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up, but Anyway, we''re going to feed all order. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history and And the reason that''s relevant is maybe again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you But it can still access their invoice history without having to call you right so it''s going to pull all orders on and offline Nice, that''s awesome um Now your question i''ll show you sorry. I''m circle back to that one, so Um, i''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart So this is where again like if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item I could just Open it up So Sorry, what are you about to ask? What was I gonna ask Sorry. Oh, yeah. No, it''s all good I I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps and I heard mail chimp in there as well Just curious about the integration of things like connect wise or salesforce Or kaseya or or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have uh integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s kind of here''s what this looks like Evolution x is open api. So technically we can integrate with any third-party app If we don''t have an existing integration It may take some dev work so there may be just be a cost associated with that And salesforce would be a big one like we could integrate salesforce and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it and so I think there''s a business case there but the Salesforce is also very different for every company The way we use salesforce at eci might be very different than you guys and so it just takes a little bit of The answer is yes But there would be a dev cost associated with it and I couldn''t even tell you what that is Those kind of are done case by case Okay But the capability is there? Yeah We can we can''t do it. So the platform is is built to integrate Okay and so for for guest users we can You know hide published pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog A thousand percent You can customize this. Okay Yep, based off of what their role is and it''s all check boxes for the most part Like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing you would just uncheck a box Um What about uh, like margin and markup rules i''m assuming we can do that per company per customer. Can we do it? But Like how complicated can we get with the rules? Like can we say hey do 20 percent unless that puts it over msrp Things like that So that''s typically data we pull from e-automate So if you''re talking just at a basic level right like uh, you could call it contract pricing Every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product That''s all data that we pull real time from e-automate now you could you could do it in evolution x as well um Just in order some erps are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website it has to match something you have in the rp2 for it to like push over correctly, but The answer is yes. I don''t know if i''m making sense on that explanation I i''m not an ema automate user So I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of e-automate on our set At a basic level the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing 100 that is I would say a table stakes feature of evolution x Um What other questions do you guys have I can show you the blog feature if you mentioned that the ai block, uh, I don''t know jeff. That might just be your thing, but How are you? It is i''ll probably be be supporting it a little bit But I think it it''s exciting for the other uh people on the call to just see how we can truly write Reinforce the the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah, two things i''ll show you something That is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer and both are pretty cool. So I Feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other e-commerce products in the market And I do think we''re doing the most with ai and this is the first thing we did about a year ago where Uh, give me a blog title anybody benefits of what What''s a break? Wi-fi Go for it Go for it robert, uh benefits of wi-fi six Wi-fi six like this. Yep Cool. Okay. I''ll type in the title. You can make the tone professional casual funny. We''ll do funny You can adjust the word length ask evo xai and it''s going to start to spit out your blog for you Now you''re going to want to proofread it but it The results it does spit out are pretty remarkable Ideally, it''s trying to take away 70 percent of the lead time of writing a blog now Once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look It will do the excerpt for you It will do the meta information for search engine optimization And kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating The buyer on how to buy office furniture If you wanted to link products into the blog, this is just where you would come in and I''m, just going to type in random numbers You would type in the skew part number the name whatever and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog so That''s just one example Chat gpt is baked in here, too So if you needed ideas for a blog title, you could just you could type that in and have it give you ideas Ideas So that''s current state, but I will show you I think I have some slides here in this deck Yes, here we go, so we are adding co-pilot to the platform we have some customers in data testing right now But this will be a full Ai assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well And jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this because it''s It''s pretty new but In this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month? It pulled that data you tell it to create a 10 discount code for those items and name it best sellers of the month So it will go do that for you. And then you say can you Essentially, can you make a marketing page? Based off of these best sellers don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you That you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website That''s insane, that''s awesome Yeah, so i''ve got a few examples in this, uh slide deck But I think you get the point like any business data you want to pull Um gross revenue or if you wanted to have extend contracts as an example This will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys and that''s again we''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but This is the direction it''s going So Lots of cool stuff with ai Yeah Another question that is probably important to talk about is is deal registration Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m, not craig might be but yeah, fill me in Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure So a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers. They want to be able to forecast it And so they will do partner initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing Okay, those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days And once we have that by saying hey customer abc is going to buy a hundred dell laptops over the next six months They go cool. That''s awesome Your new price for them is this Okay, and ideally it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool And so what''s your thought on like what are you wanting to do with that information on the e-commerce platform? Well, I mean we we pass, you know Some of the savings along but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time There''s there''s not much in the it Marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup You''re always going to end up with these these deal regs and big deal pricing type stuff Got it. So i''m going to show you I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting So It''s not just the pricing but you''re wanting to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain time frame Um, I believe so yeah, like if we could have something like your price which is good through You know march 31st or something like that Okay so Two thoughts on this and i''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do so The first thing you could do is make a promotion In the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example I could say 10 off February and I you again like this is a generic title, but you this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and the stop dates for the promotion So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates You could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer And then you would select a promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting a dollar amount off or a percentage off Which would be hey within these dates. You''ve got a 10 discount It''s going to generate a coupon code Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe Only I don''t know five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend 300 to qualify None of this might be relevant to your Example but you can set rules and conditions and then Whatever promotion you''re running you would just apply it across a group of products Okay, you apply that to a specific customer though because these are customer specific Yes, you can apply and i''m assuming you can do it without the coupon to where they just see the better pricing and know it''s Big deal pricing or whatever. Yep when they log in you might have to display a So to a few ways you could approach that right like yes when they go in Like there be a there could be a notification on their portal when you set this promotion it could send them an email or As another layer what you might need to do And this It''s a little bit of manual work, but this is honestly kind of just e-commerce. Let me just go badges You would create a product badge that would display whatever text you''re wanting it to say About the product so they know that they''re getting a 10% off within this time frame Is it customizable? Yeah, so Essentially you just type in the text that you want the badge to say and then If you want to have a different hypertext and then the text color is just a hex code. You can just select Cool, so So the application of some of the these things that would be specific to a customer''s Account or portal within the site would be for us having What am I trying to say? For example, if you have a website that you want to promote You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website So You''ll be able to log in if you wanted to check out for a customer you could like if a sales rep had to place an order or Send a customer an email And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer Or Send a customer a quote you can build quotes on the back end but the answer to your question is yes, you could Do all of that or see all of that information on the customer profile? Awesome. Okay, cool What about so a Customer purchases something. What are the rules of hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this this hit a dollar amount threshold or uh These are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return or what whatever Logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going? Yep got an order place it Yeah, so craig. I wish we had jamie here We have a technical guy on the e-automate side that could tell you what buttons we press Uh to to pause it better than I could but I know that we do it with every erp so it could be certain It can be certain orders or items or certain customers even like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out And you want them to have to approve everything that can all be customized um Some of it is dependent on the erp though. Like there''s some work That can be erp specific And I sure I mean technically how they set it up. But yes, we do that all well I imagine for you know, we we go live with this the first month or so We probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure We''ve got all the kinks worked out just to lay eyes on We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders You can give us a scenario that would concern you and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like that''s one layer and then like in all likelihood Um, all your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might typically people migrate them on Yeah, yeah just so it''s digestible for you guys if you can get a feel for like what does this look like and it''s a customer you trust and so yeah Well, jeff will attest i''m very good at breaking websites Hey They''re easy to break man. I it''s not a Yeah, it''s not difficult to do So i''ll tell you guys i''ve been i''ve been doing this 39 years um, and we''ve rolled out a lot of products and I am very proud of what cj and the team has done. This product is amazing and uh, the integration we built into the automate only enhances it so We''re excited about it. Um, i''ve I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this. So they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution And it''s exciting to get it In front of you guys for sure Awesome Cj, uh, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could please um, one of the challenge that we''re Challenges we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like? And you know how we can make sure that you know, we have the resources we need to make the solution successful Yep so two years During implementation. You''re going to get assigned a technical person And more of a customer success person So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole And they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you so that''s an actual person right that You can reach out to but the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use intercom We''re the only product within eci that uses this We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business And so again, like you have solutions experts live on here these aren''t People that are gonna like you have a problem. They''re not going to say. Yeah, let me get a hold of someone They can solve the problem like the actual Developers and solutions experts and so if you put something in the chat need help though, like I said, i''ve never Had a reply in over five minutes and they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles They''re really really really good. So They will jump on a call. Oh, yeah, absolutely absolutely And do you guys have sls in place for that or is that like Like you said five minutes is the longest you''ve that you''ve waited So if you go in here this and this is really just to cover our base It says we typically reply in under 20 minutes, there''s not a concrete sla to answer your question. This is just me Uh Giving you a look and feel but what I can do like i''ll just put something vague in the chat right now And as we''re talking we can just see how long it takes them Um I don''t know. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens, but no like to answer your question, uh Well, I can''t see that far did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond If I tell them i''m on a demo they will get they''ll be like super quick and so I did it on purpose, uh because I do I mean, um, like I am not I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years But I in nate i''m not a website person. Like i''ve never been a web developer So these demo stores I build them out myself and I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself and so um It''s quicker to get a hold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a teams chat like on Microsoft teams and so I use it all the time and uh Again, i''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but i''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. So How many people for your demo? They''re probably helping real customers instead of you right now Say that again They''re probably helping real customers. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they see something from me pop up. They''re probably annoyed but that''s okay You should know that now but they so we have a knowledge base. Um Um, so sometimes what they''ll do if it''s an answer that''s like Let me see I might have to go to a different I might have to go to my uh, Edge browser to pull this up if they If it''s an answer that''s like In our knowledge base that you guys have access to they might ping you an article real quick and say hey check paragraph five Or something like that. Um at at least case, but you''ll have access to this as well So it''s just another layer of like self-service If there''s something that you have a question about um You can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials, too. So cool I don''t know how many people they have oh, yeah, I was just curious how big that support team is that that manages that Yeah Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now So and there might be more I normally can only see three but we have 30 and again keep in mind, um There''s a team in the uk or sorry in the us and then a bulk of them are in the uk as well So yeah, you mentioned that earlier so close to 24 seven Not quite the close. Yep. Yeah Okay, awesome so Um Well, we are coming up on the hour, uh david I see that you''ve joined Uh, do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time, I mean it''s very informative Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So no all good Great Thank you. David robert anything else on your side? Uh, I think I think i''m good. I think we we just need somebody who knows how Gfi uses the automate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which It''s the same company. So I know they''re flexible but just to validate that I would say would probably be good Yeah, yeah, I agree. Um I know andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us. So i''ll have a follow-up with him And then i''m assuming at some point we need to get susan involved in this conversation I would assume so because they''re gonna have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from you know To here and groom or whatever to this and then into e-automate Yeah, and she''s gonna know just so you guys know to their the Before we got too involved or took this too far. We wanted to make sure we understood it And saw the fit but then um you know next steps for us is probably going to be getting um, like the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and And reconciliation and that kind of stuff because nobody on this call today touches that and I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with What the process would look like and and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless um process there uh For both on our side, but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now But this has been great. Yeah I''m your non-technical demo guy And so this is a craig that sounds like definitely jamie and then maybe someone from claire''s team You''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions Okay, that sounds great. So jamie, um, jamie''s my se on the automate side. So He''s from the uk. So if we can look at a time I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar In the morning if that''ll work for you some morning next week. Um jeff I can Talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys But um, we''ll get jamie and claire on a call with your group whoever that is the new group and Go over any questions they have Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that craig. So let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep Sounds good. Any other questions for cj? Well, we got this is kind of the layout of Integration, but we could get deeper in with claire. Also. Yeah, this is high level I was just just so everybody knows implementation timeline typically around six months is safe we can go faster we can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week you meet with our team and That would be standard Okay, sounds good Cool. All right, everybody. It''s great to meet you all. Um, jeff. You need anything don''t hesitate to reach out. But yeah, look forward to talking soon Absolutely. Thanks guys Thank you. Thanks everybody You', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s gonna help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point to in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. So yeah, no, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where were you gonna go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s gonna get, it''s gonna grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got a laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know, like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the Bill of Materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would, complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for JobShop Squared? For JobShop Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So, it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So, what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location in Carlsbad? Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about going to be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So, she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So, very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way, you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

You want to do Wednesday at 10 a.m.? Yes. Eastern? Yep, let''s do Wednesday. Oh, Eastern, that''s 9 o''clock here. Yeah, that should still work. We''re Central. Oh, you guys are Central. Okay. I could also do 11 a.m. Eastern, which would be 10 a.m. Eastern, or Standard. Oh, my gosh, Central. Nope, that 10 Eastern, 9 Central will work fine. Okay, perfect. And really quick, is there anything specific that y''all are looking for in kind of exploring ERP options? I mean, we want a system that''s going to track our manufacturing and costs, as well as doing the invoicing out and in and our inventory management. We have been using GP Dynamics for quite a long time, which will be sunsetting, and we haven''t been using that to its full capability. So this is add-ons to stuff we''re not doing yet that we want to be tracking and paying attention to. I got you. Okay, perfect. Well, I appreciate that.

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s. And that''s all I really know about it. And, you know, I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess, you know, what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird. It''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people. And then it became, you know, more of a focus. And so I guess it is, you know, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and, you know, through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about maybe 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, you all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said, so very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here, and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, good afternoon, Julia. My name is Hector over with ECM Manufacturing Job Boss. How you doing? With who? Job Boss. Oh, Job Boss. Yeah, I was reaching now to introduce myself. I think you had spoken with my colleague, Hannah. I just took over her territory and just wanted to introduce myself and let you know I''d be your first point of contact regarding any support regarding Job Boss. But yeah, just kind of wanted to see where you guys were at and see how the search was going for ERP solutions. Let''s see. Actually, if you can do a Zoom presentation. Are you available today? Zoom presentation? I''d have to, so I''m the scheduler for the solutions expert, Holly. Okay. Take a look at the sheets available today. Give me one second here. What time were you looking at? Maybe within an hour or two. Oh, she''s pretty. Let me see. Let me. Give me one second. Let me see if she responds real quick. But yeah, I kind of just wanted to learn a little bit more about what you guys are doing. I have some pretty good notes here. Regarding kind of what you guys are looking for, anything top of mind? Anything particularly you''d like to share? So, we''re a CNC machine shop. Correct. And it''s a small size. I think for the ERP system, we''re looking for something that''s efficient. And then, but I''m not too sure if we really need the ERP systems, since we''re really small. Okay. How many employees are we talking here? We have six. Okay. We''re actually made specifically for medium to small size job shops manufacturing. Are you guys mainly doing custom made to order things or made to stock? Yeah, made to order, made to stock, mostly prototypes. Mostly prototypes, okay. And what are some of the challenges you guys are currently facing with? What are you guys currently using? We don''t need an ERP right now. I''m just getting orders through emails or we use platforms. Okay. I think what I want is something a little bit more efficient. I know that maybe Dropbox offers something where I can tag material, tag my travelers. Correct. Yeah. And I see you guys were looking to pursue a AS91001 certification and ITAR registration. Yeah, we''re pursuing it right now. Nice. So, what percent would you say it''s made to order for you guys? 100%. Perfect. And is it just one location we''re talking here? One location. Okay. And are you guys needing integrated financials, production forecasting or warehouse management? No. Okay. And kind of what you guys are doing, I know you''re CNC machining. How complex are your building materials or do you guys have any sub-assemblies, anything like that? No. Assembly if it''s simple assembly, not welding or... Yeah. Okay. She currently has back-to-back meetings the rest of the day. Let''s see here. Did you have some availability maybe tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Do you have a number at the top of your head how much it will cost monthly? Not necessarily. For a small business. She could go over that with you. She could ballpark it for you in that conversation. So, just for full transparency, kind of the way we go about how we do this is I''m scheduled, like I said, I schedule a call with Holly, which is a solutions expert for a discovery call, just kind of seeing if we''re a right fit for you guys. And then if you see some value there, it''ll proceed to a demo. Okay. A tailored demo based on that discovery conversation. That''s why we like to have those just so we''re not wasting your guys'' time. Hey, trying to show you a demo that wouldn''t make sense if we''re not a fit for you guys and if we don''t know some more details about the business. But yeah, if you see some value in that conversation, then we''ll proceed to a demo. In that actual discovery call, you could go over pricing, ballpark pricing, as well as she''ll show you some of the job loss aspect of it. She''ll kind of show you the software, kind of how it works. But the demo, if you decide to go forward with the demo, that''s where you''ll see more in-depth. But those questions, she could definitely answer for you in the discovery call. Okay, sounds good. What time do you have some availability for tomorrow? We do 11. 11 a.m. Let me double check. She is busy. She''s one of our busier reps. Let''s see here. Did you have some time for tomorrow? She has availability for tomorrow at either 8 a.m. or what is this? 2 p.m. That''s right. 2.30 as well as 3. If anything, I''ll just give you a call back to schedule this. Okay. Okay, thank you. We''ll see if we can do that. Okay.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Hannah from ECI Manufacturing reached out to Justin to discuss Job Boss Squared, an ERP solution for manufacturing. Justin explained his new manufacturing business''s needs, including estimating, production management, and potential future growth. Hannah provided an overview of how Job Boss Squared might align with Justin''s operations and offered to connect him with a regional expert for further details.

**Key Points:**  
• **Justin''s Manufacturing Needs:** Justin''s facility is a diverse operation with multiple departments (e.g., laser cutting, powder coating, welding) and no current management systems. He seeks tools for estimating, production management, and CRM integration.  

• **Job Boss Squared Overview:** Hannah explained that Job Boss Squared is an ERP solution designed for small to midsize manufacturing shops, offering inventory management and other tools. She noted its suitability for Justin''s operations but deferred detailed technical and pricing questions to an expert.  

• **Next Steps:** Hannah proposed connecting Justin with Holly Greiner, a regional expert familiar with the system, to provide deeper insights and address specific questions. Justin agreed to the follow-up.

Hey, Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s gonna help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point to in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. So yeah, no, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where were you gonna go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s gonna get, it''s gonna grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got a laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know, like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the Bill of Materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have in the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have in structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared?

Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah.

How''s everybody doing over there? Yeah, TGIF, it''s been a week Anywhere with its own year, I''m pretty sure so Are you guys? I''m sorry. Are you guys in st. Louis for Jeff City? Stay at Lewis. Yeah Yeah, I was actually in Jeff City most of the week but back in the office today, there you go, yeah Hey Robert. Good afternoon Hey, good afternoon Jeff I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know you there''s several people invited I''ll just let you you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off Okay, I''m not sure Who all is available on our end? Robert thanks for hopping on. I think Andrews in another meeting and I''m not sure about David So it might just be us Yeah, just know that we are we''re using fathom We''re recording it so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join Cool can watch at their leisure. So Thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call evolution X It''s uh, you guys have been going down this path a little bit trying to work with a Vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already. That''s fully vetted Everything that you''re looking to have in the solution. I think we have for you guys. So We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you Jace EJ''s on the phone CJ comes from evolution X. I''m your account manager from the automate standpoint. I''m from just be, Missouri Been doing this 39 years. So happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well But anyway, CJ is going to kind of go over the product in a little high-level Please ask questions This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward So with that I''m gonna turn over to you CJ Yeah, so Chrissy Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team Really extensively last year and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo but would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on evolution X like who we are or How we work any of that type of stuff or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just The cliff notes, I mean, I''ll give you 30,000 if you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So evolution X e-commerce is a b2b e-commerce software It''s been around about 17 years And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago and it was just because they had enough Customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that see I build an integration if it just made sense for them to buy us and so Now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates Division and customer base and so we''ve had several customers I don''t know throughout the last six months beginning to onboard and it''s been a lot of fun So just think of this as a robust b2b e-commerce software that would compete with any big-box player out there but we''re bringing it to the Small medium-sized distributor within the ECI family awesome I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this So this demos for you guys stop me anywhere we can pivot I''m definitely gonna be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform But this is the flow that I''m gonna go through I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like we''ll give you a back-end overview and I''ll make a change on the home page of my website So you can see like what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage? some search functionality Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded You''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results Some marketing tools and then I will log in as a customer at the end So you can get a feel for what that''s gonna look like for your customers Okay So I pulled a few customer examples here Is that? Yes, sorry Okay, sorry misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here We design these in-house for you guys So the way this would work if you decide to go with evolution X Our design team consults with you and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do No custom design. We can go a few different routes and I''ve pulled examples of each. So this is a fully custom home page For a dealer that''s in the office supply space they also sell some Technology and other products as well But I think from a design perspective we can make this look any way you want it to look some people have a vision for What this drop-down might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side a Lot of different ways we can look to go about this But I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology any category of products They should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for So in this instance, you know, we''ll just go to printers You If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees we can have as many or as few of these as you want But again, ideally these customers are gonna be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website What if they? Excuse me. What if they have a skew and know? Exactly The product that they''re yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable 100% so that''s where some of the search capability will come into play where if you want them to be able to search by the product number reference number That can be done any way you guys want Well, we''ll have full flexibility over the search bar Okay, so it can even like index the description for I put in you know, Dell 14-inch 256 gig it''s gonna go Hey, there''s five results that have those words in the description. Okay? Yeah, it would pull up in the description the category the attributes whatever fields we need to pull it from. Absolutely So I''ll death I''ll look to show you a few different ways. We could leverage the search bar But that''s certainly one of them now looking at Less custom design this website one of our out-of-the-box themes So at a base level we have some templates or themes We call them that we can spin up and essentially we would put your color scheme your branding your logo We would put media in here from you guys or we can supply it But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like If you want to have a shop by brand Banner running across the site So Anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has unique design CJ just a quick question going back to the search searching functionality One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example It doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description Did I hear you say that Evo X actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely keywords attributes So you can go back on any given product and there''s a field where you can say We call it keywords But if you type in a keyword and associated with that product, it means that line of products will pop up Whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it Okay, and this I think is important to note I Say that we''re a white glove service, but it''s your arm and arm is probably the more accurate way to say it You''re gonna have a really good customer success team helping you build this website a lot of this is We''re gonna train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future We don''t want to stand in your way, but if you do want help with these things You''ll have live chat support from us You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to and search the way you want so But ideally we''re gonna help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live that way The search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little sub menus would pop up so Just giving you a feel for from possibilities I think we can design anything you guys would want but this will be something to think about Jeff and all of you as we go down this road if you do want customization We''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team that way they can make Recommendations and hear what you''re looking for and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. So Now something way less glamorous is my demo store I designed this so don''t judge me And I wouldn''t be the one designing your website But I''ll use this just to navigate and move some stuff around and go through the demo Let me see I''m actually gonna log out of my user and I''ll log back into him in a second Okay Back into the website. So when you guys log in this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective You''ll have access to some basic API and data reports. It''s it''s surface level there''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you but At surface level see order conversions how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly weekly basis You can drag and drop them with any of this around Chat support again We do chat support US and UK hours So it''s not quite 24-7, but it''s close and these are actual solutions experts Not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem So if you have an issue you can chat our team I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me and they can grab your screen send you articles jump on a call This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform If you see a new button somewhere, this is the new feature. We''ve added we add features monthly We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that And I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool So most Dealers would have us I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform and we can still do that if you want But it can be overkill for a lot of people so we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into evolution X so you can come in here and See how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at who''s the top users You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website how it''s trending And I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant Search results So this will be again Giving you data on when people come to your site. What keywords are they actually typing into the search bar? You might have something that is in your top ten It''s unexpected Well when someone types that in you''re gonna want to make sure that the right products are popping up as we''ve discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything? We''ve shown at this point? Are you able to slice those? Oh, sorry Yeah, I was gonna say are you able to slice those? Analytics down to like a from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day Yep up here. Okay. Yeah, and you can make it a custom range if you if you awesome So That''s good. What else Jeff? Did you have a question? Yeah from the design perspective. I''m curious of your approach is From our perspective. Do we create like a wireframe and give that to you guys? So you kind of know what to go from or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times your designers? Put together some options and then we you know, go through the approval process and editing process. Yeah, it can go either way I don''t think it hurts to have a wireframe But you don''t need one and our team is definitely not accustomed to having one so see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it then Certainly that helps but most people don''t Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you and then we do go through an iterative process So we''ll make a draft Based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting and then we might have to revise it three or four times Okay So no standard practice But what I''ll show you next the Jefferson is once we build you this site You''re gonna have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes. And so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I Use this jump to button in the top left just because it''s quicker to get around I''m gonna type in layouts So after the site is built this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website I''m gonna go into the home page So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform, but you don''t have to most of this is meant to be drag-and-drop no code and So we house all of the media content in these tiles that we call widgets For example, I have a media gallery tile if I open it up I have an image of this, you know office room if I go to And let me log out of this user if I go to the home page of my website and scroll down That image is right here on my website. So I just uploaded this from my desktop Into this widget. I don''t need to know code Now if I didn''t want to take it and say resize it or I wanted to switch it to the other side of the website You can kind of see all these boxes moving around in a very drag-and-drop format So this is kind of the general concept of moving stuff around what it looks like all that good stuff Now what I am gonna do On my website I have Some items for sale we call this an item merchandiser and it says new products Maybe it''s the end of the month You''ve got a sale going on and you want to highlight that and make it the first thing people see when they go to your website I Would come into this item merchandising widget and open it up I''ll change the title to end of month Specials if you want different living breathing list of product groups in here, you can have them If you want to change how fast the carousel is running you can make it, you know, two seconds versus three seconds But I''ll just save my changes and I''ll take this up to the top of my website Resize it save and publish Cool now if I go back to my website and hit refresh that''s gonna be a real-time change So now you''ll see the end of month specials carousel Hitting my website And I could probably do that in less than a minute if I wasn''t talking So Jeff would that mainly be you or would Yeah, most likely I''ll be the one administering the site perfect so Any questions about what it looks like to make a look and feel change or just any design oriented stuff from that perspective? from the rest of the team now flexibility and options Yeah, CJ one of the things that I do recall from a previous demo was how how you showcase How we could feature specific brands or specific products. So for example right now We''re we''re kind of doing a special on Dyna book, right? So yeah for the recording for the folks that couldn''t be with us Would you mind just talking about how we can highlight? Certain brains or certain products and then run specials on those products And then I remember even saying you could connect to the product listing to like a blog article on on such a product So would you mind just explaining to the team, please? Absolutely. So a few different ways you can leverage the search results from maximizing brands or categories of products The first point being if you wanted them to search a part number skew reference number you could do it that way Another example, my demo store is set up to where if I type in copy paper And I know this is an office supplies example, but you''ll get the point. I Type in coffee paper copy paper. I have my evolution X copy paper showing up first. This is ambitious margins I''m shooting for three hundred fifty dollars, but you get the point and I''ve got a banner displaying that Hey 45% off right and so that''s the general idea now the way we set this is pretty straightforward on The back end. There''s a feature called brand priority Again our team will help you guys set this up before for the site goes live So you won''t be alone and figuring this out But all I do is come in here and choose the brand that I''m looking to influence. I''ll just do 3m And I could say I want 3m to be number one or number ten Maybe you hate them and you want to bury them in the search results We''ll say we want them to be number one. And then you would just open up what catalog we''re pulling from. I think it''s important to note we have a Good amount of catalogs built into evolution X So if you''re an approved vendor with distributor network or a TD Cinex or Ingram We can spin those up and then you would just go Select The catalog and I''ll say technology warranties I want 3m to be the number one brand that pops up for this category And so that''s one way you can influence brands. It''s pretty straightforward Another would be Just see if I type in coffee maker I Have a Media banner displaying above products. So yes, I typed in copy maker It''s pulling up all the copy makers, but I have a bun copy banner displaying about the products So if somebody clicked that it would take me directly to those products. There''s another way you can Go about Influencing the search results or the cut the customer journey as well You could get I want to see if I have this let me see stapler I was gonna say maybe staplers I''ve seen some people do it where Maybe it''s not a brand but it''s a category like in this like if I typed in staplers Maybe it pulls up desktop staplers instead of I Don''t know like a heavy-duty stapler, so it may not be a brand maybe it''s a category you want showing up first But Jeff to your point what we see people doing More and more is called guided selling and so I think in your industry We see this being valuable just from educating the customer on how to buy your products So this is a furniture example But you''ll get the point of how this could relate to what you''re wanting to do If I''m on this customer''s website codex, and I''m looking for desk options I can get to the products But it also has this block above the products that will educate me on how to select the best office desk How to make sure it''s the correct height how to choose the right size and to Jeff''s point you''ll notice that throughout this blog links to cross-sell items that would be compatible with an office desk so you can go big or small with this type of concept, but essentially Guiding the customer towards purchasing a certain products, and then when I click office desks. It''s giving me the same type of experience But eventually I can actually get to the product that I''m looking for What questions y''all have looking at that You So I love that for the new customers the people that are new and fresh to the site Honestly though also we will have customers where there''s an expectation of consistent repeat business One of the customers for example that we''re trying to set this up for Does have an e-commerce spend on? Technology hardware in the seven-figure range so For them we want to make it a very convenient user experience can we talk just a little bit about how we could set up like favorites and reorders and kind of making that convenient for like Purchases for people that are kind of reordering the same things or bundles, and if they can be on a per customer absolutely So what I''m about to show you you guys will be able to do On the back end. I''m gonna go pull up some made-up accounts that I have so theoretically This would be the accounts that are on here if you want certain people in your company to only have access to certain accounts That''s very doable But I have CJ''s Furniture Co is a made-up account before I log in just to show you you''ll have some data at the the Organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history You can track their spent and the trajectory of that their search history the top users all of that stuff But I''ll go log as a user here So I have myself made up as an account and I''m gonna go log in on my profile So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do and I''m showing you right now you could do that You can target promotions to people specifically Just to take a step back I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer so This is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion Based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The home page of your website could look totally different as well But when your customers log in this is the portal experience that they''re gonna have on your website There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do but you can put their logo Or may log in instead of your logo. Theirs is gonna show up at the top of the website Obviously their user profile you can put their headshot They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history They could quickly just click view Get into a recent order in it email it or just click reorder all and all those items will be added to the cart So that''s one way They could do a quick reorder They have multiple saved carts, they''ll be able to view that multiple credit cards if two scenarios if They have a budget assigned to them by their boss This is where they can come in and check the status of their budget the balance remaining Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders or If they''re the person that has to approve the orders those would all filter in the orders to approve field but They''ll have access to some surface level stuff here. And then when they click their name This side menu is going to come up If you want to do rewards points you can do stuff like that like a Traditional e-commerce type of feature but a quick list would be what I think you called like a favorites list Mm-hmm. So if I was a sales rep, I can go in and build these for my customers or the customer could do it themselves But ideally if every time I have to restock the copy room I buy the same things I would just put those items on a quick list The quantities could be preset or a customer can just check a box and say add items to the cart These can be set up on recurring order if they buy the same things on the same days of every month No challenges with any of that Mm-hmm and all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process TJ quick question going back to the approver relationship Is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an an automated email to the approver? When when one of his employees Submits an order Yeah, absolutely. So this is where You will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say for example I''m a CFO and you made me a super admin user They could set this up or again you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want and so under advanced settings or approval settings And I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load Oh, there we go, so This is where they would come in and sit there There''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want and then this trigger the email to your point so if they wanted to Track by cost center. So maybe they want to track spend by department if they wanted to create budgets for specific users they could come in and do that here and if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month Anything above that''s going to acquire approval. They would save those settings Then what we do on the back end We have Email templates that can be customized and we would just associate that template with that account for that event So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens We would just tie an email template to that workflow So Does that answer the question? Yep, that does and in case you guys hear the alarms. We''re just doing our testing today So it''s not like what you know code red or anything. Okay I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it Okay. Yeah, we can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I''m gonna say it''s probably inconvenient for you Was the ice cream truck? So you''re doing a good job of got me Jeff there''s these are all the things that normally would show but I want to keep This relevant to you. So what other things are we not hit on that? You guys have questions about or want to see? If so, we have the The The capability to take credit cards through I guess the stripe platform and Then we also have the option on here to accept There for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is assuming Craig Well, are y''all using that one? I? Know One We''re currently using stripe to accept credit card payments But I think to further Chrissy''s question We''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with e automate from kind of an accounting perspective Got it. So the short answer is yes, we can in it like I''ll show you the App Store You can certainly use stripe my store is actually set up with stripe, but This is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services HubSpot is a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here, but Ideally, I don''t know Craig can probably answer your questions about net one on a separate call But if you wanted customers to obviously use net one or paid up using ACH Those are things that can be done as well, but stripe very doable Okay, Chrissy I''ll have some I get with you Chrissy on the net one side because the majority of our clients do use net one and interfaces with the automate integrates I mean and also your customer II info for using that so It''s a to me. It''s a no-brain must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate wise and get you what those percentages would be But um, yeah, let me get you in touch with them guys Okay, great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not a Hundred percent what it would look like. This is a different ERP, but Just on the customer portal and when we do integrate this to you automate there will be an invoice history tab Typically these fields are clickable when it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP so if they wanted to actually, you know hyperlink and click into that they could see it, but It will pull the invoice history on and offline orders So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still gonna pull that invoice history for them to 24 7 Okay, so that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I didn''t I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal Okay, i''m confused I actually have two questions cj one of which is is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about Do customers shoppers have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy. You said you wanted to show us how to do that To the product listing yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy you said you''re confused Yeah, can you just Recap this page that you''re on again. Yep You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect so evolution x integrates with 30 different erp systems Oh, okay. So e automate is one we work with a number of different Uh, so the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to e automate for that reason so I have a demo store that has some fake data To where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in they will have an invoice history tab So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website Yep, okay, I get it the data that looks yeah It doesn''t look exactly the same as what the automate data will look like because this is fake data just to give you an idea of what it would look like they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up, but Anyway, we''re going to feed all order. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history and And the reason that''s relevant is maybe again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you But it can still access their invoice history without having to call you right so it''s going to pull all orders on and offline Nice, that''s awesome um Now your question i''ll show you sorry. I''m circle back to that one, so Um, i''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart So this is where again like if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item I could just Open it up So Sorry, what are you about to ask? What was I gonna ask Sorry. Oh, yeah. No, it''s all good I I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps and I heard mail chimp in there as well Just curious about the integration of things like connect wise or salesforce Or kaseya or or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have uh integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s kind of here''s what this looks like Evolution x is open api. So technically we can integrate with any third-party app If we don''t have an existing integration It may take some dev work so there may be just be a cost associated with that And salesforce would be a big one like we could integrate salesforce and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it and so I think there''s a business case there but the Salesforce is also very different for every company The way we use salesforce at eci might be very different than you guys and so it just takes a little bit of The answer is yes But there would be a dev cost associated with it and I couldn''t even tell you what that is Those kind of are done case by case Okay But the capability is there? Yeah We can we can''t do it. So the platform is is built to integrate Okay and so for for guest users we can You know hide published pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog A thousand percent You can customize this. Okay Yep, based off of what their role is and it''s all check boxes for the most part Like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing you would just uncheck a box Um What about uh, like margin and markup rules i''m assuming we can do that per company per customer. Can we do it? But Like how complicated can we get with the rules? Like can we say hey do 20 percent unless that puts it over msrp Things like that So that''s typically data we pull from e-automate So if you''re talking just at a basic level right like uh, you could call it contract pricing Every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product That''s all data that we pull real time from e-automate now you could you could do it in evolution x as well um Just in order some erps are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website it has to match something you have in the rp2 for it to like push over correctly, but The answer is yes. I don''t know if i''m making sense on that explanation I i''m not an ema automate user So I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of e-automate on our set At a basic level the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing 100 that is I would say a table stakes feature of evolution x Um What other questions do you guys have I can show you the blog feature if you mentioned that the ai block, uh, I don''t know jeff. That might just be your thing, but How are you? It is i''ll probably be be supporting it a little bit But I think it it''s exciting for the other uh people on the call to just see how we can truly write Reinforce the the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah, two things i''ll show you something That is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer and both are pretty cool. So I Feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other e-commerce products in the market And I do think we''re doing the most with ai and this is the first thing we did about a year ago where Uh, give me a blog title anybody benefits of what What''s a break? Wi-fi Go for it Go for it robert, uh benefits of wi-fi six Wi-fi six like this. Yep Cool. Okay. I''ll type in the title. You can make the tone professional casual funny. We''ll do funny You can adjust the word length ask evo xai and it''s going to start to spit out your blog for you Now you''re going to want to proofread it but it The results it does spit out are pretty remarkable Ideally, it''s trying to take away 70 percent of the lead time of writing a blog now Once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look It will do the excerpt for you It will do the meta information for search engine optimization And kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating The buyer on how to buy office furniture If you wanted to link products into the blog, this is just where you would come in and I''m, just going to type in random numbers You would type in the skew part number the name whatever and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog so That''s just one example Chat gpt is baked in here, too So if you needed ideas for a blog title, you could just you could type that in and have it give you ideas Ideas So that''s current state, but I will show you I think I have some slides here in this deck Yes, here we go, so we are adding co-pilot to the platform we have some customers in data testing right now But this will be a full Ai assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well And jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this because it''s It''s pretty new but In this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month? It pulled that data you tell it to create a 10 discount code for those items and name it best sellers of the month So it will go do that for you. And then you say can you Essentially, can you make a marketing page? Based off of these best sellers don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you That you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website That''s insane, that''s awesome Yeah, so i''ve got a few examples in this, uh slide deck But I think you get the point like any business data you want to pull Um gross revenue or if you wanted to have extend contracts as an example This will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys and that''s again we''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but This is the direction it''s going So Lots of cool stuff with ai Yeah Another question that is probably important to talk about is is deal registration Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m, not craig might be but yeah, fill me in Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure So a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers. They want to be able to forecast it And so they will do partner initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing Okay, those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days And once we have that by saying hey customer abc is going to buy a hundred dell laptops over the next six months They go cool. That''s awesome Your new price for them is this Okay, and ideally it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool And so what''s your thought on like what are you wanting to do with that information on the e-commerce platform? Well, I mean we we pass, you know Some of the savings along but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time There''s there''s not much in the it Marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup You''re always going to end up with these these deal regs and big deal pricing type stuff Got it. So i''m going to show you I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting So It''s not just the pricing but you''re wanting to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain time frame Um, I believe so yeah, like if we could have something like your price which is good through You know march 31st or something like that Okay so Two thoughts on this and i''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do so The first thing you could do is make a promotion In the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example I could say 10 off February and I you again like this is a generic title, but you this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and the stop dates for the promotion So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates You could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer And then you would select a promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting a dollar amount off or a percentage off Which would be hey within these dates. You''ve got a 10 discount It''s going to generate a coupon code Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe Only I don''t know five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend 300 to qualify None of this might be relevant to your Example but you can set rules and conditions and then Whatever promotion you''re running you would just apply it across a group of products Okay, you apply that to a specific customer though because these are customer specific Yes, you can apply and i''m assuming you can do it without the coupon to where they just see the better pricing and know it''s Big deal pricing or whatever. Yep when they log in you might have to display a So to a few ways you could approach that right like yes when they go in Like there be a there could be a notification on their portal when you set this promotion it could send them an email or As another layer what you might need to do And this It''s a little bit of manual work, but this is honestly kind of just e-commerce. Let me just go badges You would create a product badge that would display whatever text you''re wanting it to say About the product so they know that they''re getting a 10% off within this time frame Is it customizable? Yeah, so Essentially you just type in the text that you want the badge to say and then If you want to have a different hypertext and then the text color is just a hex code. You can just select Cool, so So the application of some of the these things that would be specific to a customer''s Account or portal within the site would be for us having What am I trying to say? For example, if you have a website that you want to promote You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website So You''ll be able to log in if you wanted to check out for a customer you could like if a sales rep had to place an order or Send a customer an email And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer Or Send a customer a quote you can build quotes on the back end but the answer to your question is yes, you could Do all of that or see all of that information on the customer profile? Awesome. Okay, cool What about so a Customer purchases something. What are the rules of hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this this hit a dollar amount threshold or uh These are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return or what whatever Logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going? Yep got an order place it Yeah, so craig. I wish we had jamie here We have a technical guy on the e-automate side that could tell you what buttons we press Uh to to pause it better than I could but I know that we do it with every erp so it could be certain It can be certain orders or items or certain customers even like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out And you want them to have to approve everything that can all be customized um Some of it is dependent on the erp though. Like there''s some work That can be erp specific And I sure I mean technically how they set it up. But yes, we do that all well I imagine for you know, we we go live with this the first month or so We probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure We''ve got all the kinks worked out just to lay eyes on We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders You can give us a scenario that would concern you and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like that''s one layer and then like in all likelihood Um, all your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might typically people migrate them on Yeah, yeah just so it''s digestible for you guys if you can get a feel for like what does this look like and it''s a customer you trust and so yeah Well, jeff will attest i''m very good at breaking websites Hey They''re easy to break man. I it''s not a Yeah, it''s not difficult to do So i''ll tell you guys i''ve been i''ve been doing this 39 years um, and we''ve rolled out a lot of products and I am very proud of what cj and the team has done. This product is amazing and uh, the integration we built into the automate only enhances it so We''re excited about it. Um, i''ve I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this. So they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution And it''s exciting to get it In front of you guys for sure Awesome Cj, uh, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could please um, one of the challenge that we''re Challenges we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like? And you know how we can make sure that you know, we have the resources we need to make the solution successful Yep so two years During implementation. You''re going to get assigned a technical person And more of a customer success person So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole And they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you so that''s an actual person right that You can reach out to but the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use intercom We''re the only product within eci that uses this We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business And so again, like you have solutions experts live on here these aren''t People that are gonna like you have a problem. They''re not going to say. Yeah, let me get a hold of someone They can solve the problem like the actual Developers and solutions experts and so if you put something in the chat need help though, like I said, i''ve never Had a reply in over five minutes and they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles They''re really really really good. So They will jump on a call. Oh, yeah, absolutely absolutely And do you guys have sls in place for that or is that like Like you said five minutes is the longest you''ve that you''ve waited So if you go in here this and this is really just to cover our base It says we typically reply in under 20 minutes, there''s not a concrete sla to answer your question. This is just me Uh Giving you a look and feel but what I can do like i''ll just put something vague in the chat right now And as we''re talking we can just see how long it takes them Um I don''t know. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens, but no like to answer your question, uh Well, I can''t see that far did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond If I tell them i''m on a demo they will get they''ll be like super quick and so I did it on purpose, uh because I do I mean, um, like I am not I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years But I in nate i''m not a website person. Like i''ve never been a web developer So these demo stores I build them out myself and I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself and so um It''s quicker to get a hold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a teams chat like on Microsoft teams and so I use it all the time and uh Again, i''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but i''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. So How many people for your demo? They''re probably helping real customers instead of you right now Say that again They''re probably helping real customers. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they see something from me pop up. They''re probably annoyed but that''s okay You should know that now but they so we have a knowledge base. Um Um, so sometimes what they''ll do if it''s an answer that''s like Let me see I might have to go to a different I might have to go to my uh, Edge browser to pull this up if they If it''s an answer that''s like In our knowledge base that you guys have access to they might ping you an article real quick and say hey check paragraph five Or something like that. Um at at least case, but you''ll have access to this as well So it''s just another layer of like self-service If there''s something that you have a question about um You can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials, too. So cool I don''t know how many people they have oh, yeah, I was just curious how big that support team is that that manages that Yeah Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now So and there might be more I normally can only see three but we have 30 and again keep in mind, um There''s a team in the uk or sorry in the us and then a bulk of them are in the uk as well So yeah, you mentioned that earlier so close to 24 seven Not quite the close. Yep. Yeah Okay, awesome so Um Well, we are coming up on the hour, uh david I see that you''ve joined Uh, do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time, I mean it''s very informative Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So no all good Great Thank you. David robert anything else on your side? Uh, I think I think i''m good. I think we we just need somebody who knows how Gfi uses the automate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which It''s the same company. So I know they''re flexible but just to validate that I would say would probably be good Yeah, yeah, I agree. Um I know andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us. So i''ll have a follow-up with him And then i''m assuming at some point we need to get susan involved in this conversation I would assume so because they''re gonna have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from you know To here and groom or whatever to this and then into e-automate Yeah, and she''s gonna know just so you guys know to their the Before we got too involved or took this too far. We wanted to make sure we understood it And saw the fit but then um you know next steps for us is probably going to be getting um, like the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and And reconciliation and that kind of stuff because nobody on this call today touches that and I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with What the process would look like and and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless um process there uh For both on our side, but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now But this has been great. Yeah I''m your non-technical demo guy And so this is a craig that sounds like definitely jamie and then maybe someone from claire''s team You''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions Okay, that sounds great. So jamie, um, jamie''s my se on the automate side. So He''s from the uk. So if we can look at a time I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar In the morning if that''ll work for you some morning next week. Um jeff I can Talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys But um, we''ll get jamie and claire on a call with your group whoever that is the new group and Go over any questions they have Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that craig. So let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep Sounds good. Any other questions for cj? Well, we got this is kind of the layout of Integration, but we could get deeper in with claire. Also. Yeah, this is high level I was just just so everybody knows implementation timeline typically around six months is safe we can go faster we can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week you meet with our team and That would be standard Okay, sounds good Cool. All right, everybody. It''s great to meet you all. Um, jeff. You need anything don''t hesitate to reach out. But yeah, look forward to talking soon Absolutely. Thanks guys Thank you. Thanks everybody You', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Yeah Yeah, I was actually in Jeff City most of the week but back in the office today, there you go, yeah Hey Robert. Good afternoon Hey, good afternoon Jeff I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know you there''s several people invited I''ll just let you you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off Okay, I''m not sure Who all is available on our end? Robert thanks for hopping on. I think Andrews in another meeting and I''m not sure about David So it might just be us Yeah, just know that we are we''re using fathom We''re recording it so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join Cool can watch at their leisure. So Thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call evolution X It''s uh, you guys have been going down this path a little bit trying to work with a Vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already. That''s fully vetted Everything that you''re looking to have in the solution. I think we have for you guys. So We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you Jace EJ''s on the phone CJ comes from evolution X. I''m your account manager from the automate standpoint. I''m from just be, Missouri Been doing this 39 years. So happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well But anyway, CJ is going to kind of go over the product in a little high-level Please ask questions This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward So with that I''m gonna turn over to you CJ Yeah, so Chrissy Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team Really extensively last year and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo but would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on evolution X like who we are or How we work any of that type of stuff or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just The cliff notes, I mean, I''ll give you 30,000 if you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So evolution X e-commerce is a b2b e-commerce software It''s been around about 17 years And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago and it was just because they had enough Customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that see I build an integration if it just made sense for them to buy us and so Now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates Division and customer base and so we''ve had several customers I don''t know throughout the last six months beginning to onboard and it''s been a lot of fun So just think of this as a robust b2b e-commerce software that would compete with any big-box player out there but we''re bringing it to the Small medium-sized distributor within the ECI family awesome I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this So this demos for you guys stop me anywhere we can pivot I''m definitely gonna be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform But this is the flow that I''m gonna go through I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like we''ll give you a back-end overview and I''ll make a change on the home page of my website So you can see like what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage? some search functionality Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded You''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results Some marketing tools and then I will log in as a customer at the end So you can get a feel for what that''s gonna look like for your customers Okay So I pulled a few customer examples here Is that? Yes, sorry Okay, sorry misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here We design these in-house for you guys So the way this would work if you decide to go with evolution X Our design team consults with you and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do No custom design. We can go a few different routes and I''ve pulled examples of each. So this is a fully custom home page For a dealer that''s in the office supply space they also sell some Technology and other products as well But I think from a design perspective we can make this look any way you want it to look some people have a vision for What this drop-down might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side a Lot of different ways we can look to go about this But I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology any category of products They should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for So in this instance, you know, we''ll just go to printers You If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees we can have as many or as few of these as you want But again, ideally these customers are gonna be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website What if they? Excuse me. What if they have a skew and know? Exactly The product that they''re yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable 100% so that''s where some of the search capability will come into play where if you want them to be able to search by the product number reference number That can be done any way you guys want Well, we''ll have full flexibility over the search bar Okay, so it can even like index the description for I put in you know, Dell 14-inch 256 gig it''s gonna go Hey, there''s five results that have those words in the description. Okay? Yeah, it would pull up in the description the category the attributes whatever fields we need to pull it from. Absolutely So I''ll death I''ll look to show you a few different ways. We could leverage the search bar But that''s certainly one of them now looking at Less custom design this website one of our out-of-the-box themes So at a base level we have some templates or themes We call them that we can spin up and essentially we would put your color scheme your branding your logo We would put media in here from you guys or we can supply it But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like If you want to have a shop by brand Banner running across the site So Anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has unique design CJ just a quick question going back to the search searching functionality One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example It doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description Did I hear you say that Evo X actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely keywords attributes So you can go back on any given product and there''s a field where you can say We call it keywords But if you type in a keyword and associated with that product, it means that line of products will pop up Whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it Okay, and this I think is important to note I Say that we''re a white glove service, but it''s your arm and arm is probably the more accurate way to say it You''re gonna have a really good customer success team helping you build this website a lot of this is We''re gonna train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future We don''t want to stand in your way, but if you do want help with these things You''ll have live chat support from us You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to and search the way you want so But ideally we''re gonna help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live that way The search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little sub menus would pop up so Just giving you a feel for from possibilities I think we can design anything you guys would want but this will be something to think about Jeff and all of you as we go down this road if you do want customization We''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team that way they can make Recommendations and hear what you''re looking for and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. So Now something way less glamorous is my demo store I designed this so don''t judge me And I wouldn''t be the one designing your website But I''ll use this just to navigate and move some stuff around and go through the demo Let me see I''m actually gonna log out of my user and I''ll log back into him in a second Okay Back into the website. So when you guys log in this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective You''ll have access to some basic API and data reports. It''s it''s surface level there''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you but At surface level see order conversions how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly weekly basis You can drag and drop them with any of this around Chat support again We do chat support US and UK hours So it''s not quite 24-7, but it''s close and these are actual solutions experts Not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem So if you have an issue you can chat our team I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me and they can grab your screen send you articles jump on a call This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform If you see a new button somewhere, this is the new feature. We''ve added we add features monthly We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that And I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool So most Dealers would have us I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform and we can still do that if you want But it can be overkill for a lot of people so we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into evolution X so you can come in here and See how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at who''s the top users You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website how it''s trending And I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant Search results So this will be again Giving you data on when people come to your site. What keywords are they actually typing into the search bar? You might have something that is in your top ten It''s unexpected Well when someone types that in you''re gonna want to make sure that the right products are popping up as we''ve discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything? We''ve shown at this point? Are you able to slice those? Oh, sorry Yeah, I was gonna say are you able to slice those? Analytics down to like a from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day Yep up here. Okay. Yeah, and you can make it a custom range if you if you awesome So That''s good. What else Jeff? Did you have a question? Yeah from the design perspective. I''m curious of your approach is From our perspective. Do we create like a wireframe and give that to you guys? So you kind of know what to go from or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times your designers? Put together some options and then we you know, go through the approval process and editing process. Yeah, it can go either way I don''t think it hurts to have a wireframe But you don''t need one and our team is definitely not accustomed to having one so see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it then Certainly that helps but most people don''t Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you and then we do go through an iterative process So we''ll make a draft Based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting and then we might have to revise it three or four times Okay So no standard practice But what I''ll show you next the Jefferson is once we build you this site You''re gonna have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes. And so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I Use this jump to button in the top left just because it''s quicker to get around I''m gonna type in layouts So after the site is built this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website I''m gonna go into the home page So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform, but you don''t have to most of this is meant to be drag-and-drop no code and So we house all of the media content in these tiles that we call widgets For example, I have a media gallery tile if I open it up I have an image of this, you know office room if I go to And let me log out of this user if I go to the home page of my website and scroll down That image is right here on my website. So I just uploaded this from my desktop Into this widget. I don''t need to know code Now if I didn''t want to take it and say resize it or I wanted to switch it to the other side of the website You can kind of see all these boxes moving around in a very drag-and-drop format So this is kind of the general concept of moving stuff around what it looks like all that good stuff Now what I am gonna do On my website I have Some items for sale we call this an item merchandiser and it says new products Maybe it''s the end of the month You''ve got a sale going on and you want to highlight that and make it the first thing people see when they go to your website I Would come into this item merchandising widget and open it up I''ll change the title to end of month Specials if you want different living breathing list of product groups in here, you can have them If you want to change how fast the carousel is running you can make it, you know, two seconds versus three seconds But I''ll just save my changes and I''ll take this up to the top of my website Resize it save and publish Cool now if I go back to my website and hit refresh that''s gonna be a real-time change So now you''ll see the end of month specials carousel Hitting my website And I could probably do that in less than a minute if I wasn''t talking So Jeff would that mainly be you or would Yeah, most likely I''ll be the one administering the site perfect so Any questions about what it looks like to make a look and feel change or just any design oriented stuff from that perspective? from the rest of the team now flexibility and options Yeah, CJ one of the things that I do recall from a previous demo was how how you showcase How we could feature specific brands or specific products. So for example right now We''re we''re kind of doing a special on Dyna book, right? So yeah for the recording for the folks that couldn''t be with us Would you mind just talking about how we can highlight? Certain brains or certain products and then run specials on those products And then I remember even saying you could connect to the product listing to like a blog article on on such a product So would you mind just explaining to the team, please? Absolutely. So a few different ways you can leverage the search results from maximizing brands or categories of products The first point being if you wanted them to search a part number skew reference number you could do it that way Another example, my demo store is set up to where if I type in copy paper And I know this is an office supplies example, but you''ll get the point. I Type in coffee paper copy paper. I have my evolution X copy paper showing up first. This is ambitious margins I''m shooting for three hundred fifty dollars, but you get the point and I''ve got a banner displaying that Hey 45% off right and so that''s the general idea now the way we set this is pretty straightforward on The back end. There''s a feature called brand priority Again our team will help you guys set this up before for the site goes live So you won''t be alone and figuring this out But all I do is come in here and choose the brand that I''m looking to influence. I''ll just do 3m And I could say I want 3m to be number one or number ten Maybe you hate them and you want to bury them in the search results We''ll say we want them to be number one. And then you would just open up what catalog we''re pulling from. I think it''s important to note we have a Good amount of catalogs built into evolution X So if you''re an approved vendor with distributor network or a TD Cinex or Ingram We can spin those up and then you would just go Select The catalog and I''ll say technology warranties I want 3m to be the number one brand that pops up for this category And so that''s one way you can influence brands. It''s pretty straightforward Another would be Just see if I type in coffee maker I Have a Media banner displaying above products. So yes, I typed in copy maker It''s pulling up all the copy makers, but I have a bun copy banner displaying about the products So if somebody clicked that it would take me directly to those products. There''s another way you can Go about Influencing the search results or the cut the customer journey as well You could get I want to see if I have this let me see stapler I was gonna say maybe staplers I''ve seen some people do it where Maybe it''s not a brand but it''s a category like in this like if I typed in staplers Maybe it pulls up desktop staplers instead of I Don''t know like a heavy-duty stapler, so it may not be a brand maybe it''s a category you want showing up first But Jeff to your point what we see people doing More and more is called guided selling and so I think in your industry We see this being valuable just from educating the customer on how to buy your products So this is a furniture example But you''ll get the point of how this could relate to what you''re wanting to do If I''m on this customer''s website codex, and I''m looking for desk options I can get to the products But it also has this block above the products that will educate me on how to select the best office desk How to make sure it''s the correct height how to choose the right size and to Jeff''s point you''ll notice that throughout this blog links to cross-sell items that would be compatible with an office desk so you can go big or small with this type of concept, but essentially Guiding the customer towards purchasing a certain products, and then when I click office desks. It''s giving me the same type of experience But eventually I can actually get to the product that I''m looking for What questions y''all have looking at that You So I love that for the new customers the people that are new and fresh to the site Honestly though also we will have customers where there''s an expectation of consistent repeat business One of the customers for example that we''re trying to set this up for Does have an e-commerce spend on? Technology hardware in the seven-figure range so For them we want to make it a very convenient user experience can we talk just a little bit about how we could set up like favorites and reorders and kind of making that convenient for like Purchases for people that are kind of reordering the same things or bundles, and if they can be on a per customer absolutely So what I''m about to show you you guys will be able to do On the back end. I''m gonna go pull up some made-up accounts that I have so theoretically This would be the accounts that are on here if you want certain people in your company to only have access to certain accounts That''s very doable But I have CJ''s Furniture Co is a made-up account before I log in just to show you you''ll have some data at the the Organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history You can track their spent and the trajectory of that their search history the top users all of that stuff But I''ll go log as a user here So I have myself made up as an account and I''m gonna go log in on my profile So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do and I''m showing you right now you could do that You can target promotions to people specifically Just to take a step back I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer so This is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion Based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The home page of your website could look totally different as well But when your customers log in this is the portal experience that they''re gonna have on your website There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do but you can put their logo Or may log in instead of your logo. Theirs is gonna show up at the top of the website Obviously their user profile you can put their headshot They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history They could quickly just click view Get into a recent order in it email it or just click reorder all and all those items will be added to the cart So that''s one way They could do a quick reorder They have multiple saved carts, they''ll be able to view that multiple credit cards if two scenarios if They have a budget assigned to them by their boss This is where they can come in and check the status of their budget the balance remaining Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders or If they''re the person that has to approve the orders those would all filter in the orders to approve field but They''ll have access to some surface level stuff here. And then when they click their name This side menu is going to come up If you want to do rewards points you can do stuff like that like a Traditional e-commerce type of feature but a quick list would be what I think you called like a favorites list Mm-hmm. So if I was a sales rep, I can go in and build these for my customers or the customer could do it themselves But ideally if every time I have to restock the copy room I buy the same things I would just put those items on a quick list The quantities could be preset or a customer can just check a box and say add items to the cart These can be set up on recurring order if they buy the same things on the same days of every month No challenges with any of that Mm-hmm and all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process TJ quick question going back to the approver relationship Is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an an automated email to the approver? When when one of his employees Submits an order Yeah, absolutely. So this is where You will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say for example I''m a CFO and you made me a super admin user They could set this up or again you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want and so under advanced settings or approval settings And I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load Oh, there we go, so This is where they would come in and sit there There''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want and then this trigger the email to your point so if they wanted to Track by cost center. So maybe they want to track spend by department if they wanted to create budgets for specific users they could come in and do that here and if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month Anything above that''s going to acquire approval. They would save those settings Then what we do on the back end We have Email templates that can be customized and we would just associate that template with that account for that event So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens We would just tie an email template to that workflow So Does that answer the question? Yep, that does and in case you guys hear the alarms. We''re just doing our testing today So it''s not like what you know code red or anything. Okay I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it Okay. Yeah, we can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I''m gonna say it''s probably inconvenient for you Was the ice cream truck? So you''re doing a good job of got me Jeff there''s these are all the things that normally would show but I want to keep This relevant to you. So what other things are we not hit on that? You guys have questions about or want to see? If so, we have the The The capability to take credit cards through I guess the stripe platform and Then we also have the option on here to accept There for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is assuming Craig Well, are y''all using that one? I? Know One We''re currently using stripe to accept credit card payments But I think to further Chrissy''s question We''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with e automate from kind of an accounting perspective Got it. So the short answer is yes, we can in it like I''ll show you the App Store You can certainly use stripe my store is actually set up with stripe, but This is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services HubSpot is a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here, but Ideally, I don''t know Craig can probably answer your questions about net one on a separate call But if you wanted customers to obviously use net one or paid up using ACH Those are things that can be done as well, but stripe very doable Okay, Chrissy I''ll have some I get with you Chrissy on the net one side because the majority of our clients do use net one and interfaces with the automate integrates I mean and also your customer II info for using that so It''s a to me. It''s a no-brain must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate wise and get you what those percentages would be But um, yeah, let me get you in touch with them guys Okay, great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not a Hundred percent what it would look like. This is a different ERP, but Just on the customer portal and when we do integrate this to you automate there will be an invoice history tab Typically these fields are clickable when it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP so if they wanted to actually, you know hyperlink and click into that they could see it, but It will pull the invoice history on and offline orders So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still gonna pull that invoice history for them to 24 7 Okay, so that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I didn''t I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal Okay, i''m confused I actually have two questions cj one of which is is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about Do customers shoppers have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy. You said you wanted to show us how to do that To the product listing yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy you said you''re confused Yeah, can you just Recap this page that you''re on again. Yep You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect so evolution x integrates with 30 different erp systems Oh, okay. So e automate is one we work with a number of different Uh, so the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to e automate for that reason so I have a demo store that has some fake data To where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in they will have an invoice history tab So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website Yep, okay, I get it the data that looks yeah It doesn''t look exactly the same as what the automate data will look like because this is fake data just to give you an idea of what it would look like they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up, but Anyway, we''re going to feed all order. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history and And the reason that''s relevant is maybe again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you But it can still access their invoice history without having to call you right so it''s going to pull all orders on and offline Nice, that''s awesome um Now your question i''ll show you sorry. I''m circle back to that one, so Um, i''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart So this is where again like if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item I could just Open it up So Sorry, what are you about to ask? What was I gonna ask Sorry. Oh, yeah. No, it''s all good I I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps and I heard mail chimp in there as well Just curious about the integration of things like connect wise or salesforce Or kaseya or or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have uh integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s kind of here''s what this looks like Evolution x is open api. So technically we can integrate with any third-party app If we don''t have an existing integration It may take some dev work so there may be just be a cost associated with that And salesforce would be a big one like we could integrate salesforce and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it and so I think there''s a business case there but the Salesforce is also very different for every company The way we use salesforce at eci might be very different than you guys and so it just takes a little bit of The answer is yes But there would be a dev cost associated with it and I couldn''t even tell you what that is Those kind of are done case by case Okay But the capability is there? Yeah We can we can''t do it. So the platform is is built to integrate Okay and so for for guest users we can You know hide published pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog A thousand percent You can customize this. Okay Yep, based off of what their role is and it''s all check boxes for the most part Like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing you would just uncheck a box Um What about uh, like margin and markup rules i''m assuming we can do that per company per customer. Can we do it? But Like how complicated can we get with the rules? Like can we say hey do 20 percent unless that puts it over msrp Things like that So that''s typically data we pull from e-automate So if you''re talking just at a basic level right like uh, you could call it contract pricing Every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product That''s all data that we pull real time from e-automate now you could you could do it in evolution x as well um Just in order some erps are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website it has to match something you have in the rp2 for it to like push over correctly, but The answer is yes. I don''t know if i''m making sense on that explanation I i''m not an ema automate user So I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of e-automate on our set At a basic level the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing 100 that is I would say a table stakes feature of evolution x Um What other questions do you guys have I can show you the blog feature if you mentioned that the ai block, uh, I don''t know jeff. That might just be your thing, but How are you? It is i''ll probably be be supporting it a little bit But I think it it''s exciting for the other uh people on the call to just see how we can truly write Reinforce the the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah, two things i''ll show you something That is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer and both are pretty cool. So I Feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other e-commerce products in the market And I do think we''re doing the most with ai and this is the first thing we did about a year ago where Uh, give me a blog title anybody benefits of what What''s a break? Wi-fi Go for it Go for it robert, uh benefits of wi-fi six Wi-fi six like this. Yep Cool. Okay. I''ll type in the title. You can make the tone professional casual funny. We''ll do funny You can adjust the word length ask evo xai and it''s going to start to spit out your blog for you Now you''re going to want to proofread it but it The results it does spit out are pretty remarkable Ideally, it''s trying to take away 70 percent of the lead time of writing a blog now Once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look It will do the excerpt for you It will do the meta information for search engine optimization And kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating The buyer on how to buy office furniture If you wanted to link products into the blog, this is just where you would come in and I''m, just going to type in random numbers You would type in the skew part number the name whatever and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog so That''s just one example Chat gpt is baked in here, too So if you needed ideas for a blog title, you could just you could type that in and have it give you ideas Ideas So that''s current state, but I will show you I think I have some slides here in this deck Yes, here we go, so we are adding co-pilot to the platform we have some customers in data testing right now But this will be a full Ai assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well And jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this because it''s It''s pretty new but In this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month? It pulled that data you tell it to create a 10 discount code for those items and name it best sellers of the month So it will go do that for you. And then you say can you Essentially, can you make a marketing page? Based off of these best sellers don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you That you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website That''s insane, that''s awesome Yeah, so i''ve got a few examples in this, uh slide deck But I think you get the point like any business data you want to pull Um gross revenue or if you wanted to have extend contracts as an example This will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys and that''s again we''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but This is the direction it''s going So Lots of cool stuff with ai Yeah Another question that is probably important to talk about is is deal registration Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m, not craig might be but yeah, fill me in Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure So a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers. They want to be able to forecast it And so they will do partner initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing Okay, those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days And once we have that by saying hey customer abc is going to buy a hundred dell laptops over the next six months They go cool. That''s awesome Your new price for them is this Okay, and ideally it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool And so what''s your thought on like what are you wanting to do with that information on the e-commerce platform? Well, I mean we we pass, you know Some of the savings along but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time There''s there''s not much in the it Marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup You''re always going to end up with these these deal regs and big deal pricing type stuff Got it. So i''m going to show you I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting So It''s not just the pricing but you''re wanting to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain time frame Um, I believe so yeah, like if we could have something like your price which is good through You know march 31st or something like that Okay so Two thoughts on this and i''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do so The first thing you could do is make a promotion In the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example I could say 10 off February and I you again like this is a generic title, but you this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and the stop dates for the promotion So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates You could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer And then you would select a promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting a dollar amount off or a percentage off Which would be hey within these dates. You''ve got a 10 discount It''s going to generate a coupon code Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe Only I don''t know five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend 300 to qualify None of this might be relevant to your Example but you can set rules and conditions and then Whatever promotion you''re running you would just apply it across a group of products Okay, you apply that to a specific customer though because these are customer specific Yes, you can apply and i''m assuming you can do it without the coupon to where they just see the better pricing and know it''s Big deal pricing or whatever. Yep when they log in you might have to display a So to a few ways you could approach that right like yes when they go in Like there be a there could be a notification on their portal when you set this promotion it could send them an email or As another layer what you might need to do And this It''s a little bit of manual work, but this is honestly kind of just e-commerce. Let me just go badges You would create a product badge that would display whatever text you''re wanting it to say About the product so they know that they''re getting a 10% off within this time frame Is it customizable? Yeah, so Essentially you just type in the text that you want the badge to say and then If you want to have a different hypertext and then the text color is just a hex code. You can just select Cool, so So the application of some of the these things that would be specific to a customer''s Account or portal within the site would be for us having What am I trying to say? For example, if you have a website that you want to promote You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website So You''ll be able to log in if you wanted to check out for a customer you could like if a sales rep had to place an order or Send a customer an email And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer Or Send a customer a quote you can build quotes on the back end but the answer to your question is yes, you could Do all of that or see all of that information on the customer profile? Awesome. Okay, cool What about so a Customer purchases something. What are the rules of hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this this hit a dollar amount threshold or uh These are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return or what whatever Logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going? Yep got an order place it Yeah, so craig. I wish we had jamie here We have a technical guy on the e-automate side that could tell you what buttons we press Uh to to pause it better than I could but I know that we do it with every erp so it could be certain It can be certain orders or items or certain customers even like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out And you want them to have to approve everything that can all be customized um Some of it is dependent on the erp though. Like there''s some work That can be erp specific And I sure I mean technically how they set it up. But yes, we do that all well I imagine for you know, we we go live with this the first month or so We probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure We''ve got all the kinks worked out just to lay eyes on We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders You can give us a scenario that would concern you and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like that''s one layer and then like in all likelihood Um, all your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might typically people migrate them on Yeah, yeah just so it''s digestible for you guys if you can get a feel for like what does this look like and it''s a customer you trust and so yeah Well, jeff will attest i''m very good at breaking websites Hey They''re easy to break man. I it''s not a Yeah, it''s not difficult to do So i''ll tell you guys i''ve been i''ve been doing this 39 years um, and we''ve rolled out a lot of products and I am very proud of what cj and the team has done. This product is amazing and uh, the integration we built into the automate only enhances it so We''re excited about it. Um, i''ve I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this. So they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution And it''s exciting to get it In front of you guys for sure Awesome Cj, uh, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could please um, one of the challenge that we''re Challenges we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like? And you know how we can make sure that you know, we have the resources we need to make the solution successful Yep so two years During implementation. You''re going to get assigned a technical person And more of a customer success person So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole And they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you so that''s an actual person right that You can reach out to but the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use intercom We''re the only product within eci that uses this We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business And so again, like you have solutions experts live on here these aren''t People that are gonna like you have a problem. They''re not going to say. Yeah, let me get a hold of someone They can solve the problem like the actual Developers and solutions experts and so if you put something in the chat need help though, like I said, i''ve never Had a reply in over five minutes and they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles They''re really really really good. So They will jump on a call. Oh, yeah, absolutely absolutely And do you guys have sls in place for that or is that like Like you said five minutes is the longest you''ve that you''ve waited So if you go in here this and this is really just to cover our base It says we typically reply in under 20 minutes, there''s not a concrete sla to answer your question. This is just me Uh Giving you a look and feel but what I can do like i''ll just put something vague in the chat right now And as we''re talking we can just see how long it takes them Um I don''t know. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens, but no like to answer your question, uh Well, I can''t see that far did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond If I tell them i''m on a demo they will get they''ll be like super quick and so I did it on purpose, uh because I do I mean, um, like I am not I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years But I in nate i''m not a website person. Like i''ve never been a web developer So these demo stores I build them out myself and I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself and so um It''s quicker to get a hold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a teams chat like on Microsoft teams and so I use it all the time and uh Again, i''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but i''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. So How many people for your demo? They''re probably helping real customers instead of you right now Say that again They''re probably helping real customers. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they see something from me pop up. They''re probably annoyed but that''s okay You should know that now but they so we have a knowledge base. Um Um, so sometimes what they''ll do if it''s an answer that''s like Let me see I might have to go to a different I might have to go to my uh, Edge browser to pull this up if they If it''s an answer that''s like In our knowledge base that you guys have access to they might ping you an article real quick and say hey check paragraph five Or something like that. Um at at least case, but you''ll have access to this as well So it''s just another layer of like self-service If there''s something that you have a question about um You can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials, too. So cool I don''t know how many people they have oh, yeah, I was just curious how big that support team is that that manages that Yeah Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now So and there might be more I normally can only see three but we have 30 and again keep in mind, um There''s a team in the uk or sorry in the us and then a bulk of them are in the uk as well So yeah, you mentioned that earlier so close to 24 seven Not quite the close. Yep. Yeah Okay, awesome so Um Well, we are coming up on the hour, uh david I see that you''ve joined Uh, do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time, I mean it''s very informative Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So no all good Great Thank you. David robert anything else on your side? Uh, I think I think i''m good. I think we we just need somebody who knows how Gfi uses the automate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which It''s the same company. So I know they''re flexible but just to validate that I would say would probably be good Yeah, yeah, I agree. Um I know andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us. So i''ll have a follow-up with him And then i''m assuming at some point we need to get susan involved in this conversation I would assume so because they''re gonna have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from you know To here and groom or whatever to this and then into e-automate Yeah, and she''s gonna know just so you guys know to their the Before we got too involved or took this too far. We wanted to make sure we understood it And saw the fit but then um you know next steps for us is probably going to be getting um, like the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and And reconciliation and that kind of stuff because nobody on this call today touches that and I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with What the process would look like and and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless um process there uh For both on our side, but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now But this has been great. Yeah I''m your non-technical demo guy And so this is a craig that sounds like definitely jamie and then maybe someone from claire''s team You''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions Okay, that sounds great. So jamie, um, jamie''s my se on the automate side. So He''s from the uk. So if we can look at a time I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar In the morning if that''ll work for you some morning next week. Um jeff I can Talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys But um, we''ll get jamie and claire on a call with your group whoever that is the new group and Go over any questions they have Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that craig. So let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep Sounds good. Any other questions for cj? Well, we got this is kind of the layout of Integration, but we could get deeper in with claire. Also. Yeah, this is high level I was just just so everybody knows implementation timeline typically around six months is safe we can go faster we can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week you meet with our team and That would be standard Okay, sounds good Cool. All right, everybody. It''s great to meet you all. Um, jeff. You need anything don''t hesitate to reach out. But yeah, look forward to talking soon Absolutely. Thanks guys Thank you. Thanks everybody You', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, Sabrina. It''s Tim over at Bolt Software. Hey, Tim. How are you doing? I''m doing okay. All right, all right. Going to make it. It''s the weekend, and it''s a long one, so I''ll take it. My wife and I are going on vacation, celebrating our anniversary and her birthday. Well, congratulations both directions. Yeah, we are in the final hours. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, I hope that I don''t take up too much of your time. So I''m really walking into this blind. I don''t really know how to start this, so I''ll let you go, and then I''ll give you the information that you need. Yeah, for sure. I do this every day, all day, so I''m happy to guide you through this process, no problem. I am curious, how did you hear about us? Well, so the owner of the company has a friend that apparently uses you guys. I don''t know which friend this is. I don''t know what business that it''s really for. So he told me about it the other day, sent me a link, and I was just kind of going over it, and I''m like, look, I don''t know if it''ll work for us, but it''s worth a phone call. It''s worth asking questions, giving them information, and seeing where we land with this. So that''s where we are. Love it. Sounds good. So the way that I find it best is I can give you a 30,000-foot flyover of who we work with and what we do, and then I''ll kind of just ask some questions about your business. And at the end of this, the whole idea is just to see if it makes sense to progress to a demo, or I''ll tell you, hey, this system is not built for you guys. I don''t think it''s worth your time. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that''s perfect. Cool. So just at a very high level, we are a software product built specifically for trade contractors that work with production home builders or custom home builders to a degree. But from the ground up, we are designed to centralize the PO management process. If you''re working out of builder portals like BuildPro, SupplyPro, BuilderTrend, ITK, stuff like that, and try to bring all of that into one place to make it easy to track all the details to every project, such as scheduling, such as documents, photos, time tracking, contracts that you agree with the builder on, things of that nature. And then we provide your team with a mobile app so that everybody''s aligned in real time. They can take photos in the field, send pictures back to the office, and then you have the way of tracking billing and getting that information into an accounting system so that everything just syncs up and it''s just one unified single source of truth. Okay. Big things that we typically help with are companies who are really struggling to just stay on top of the schedules because things change so consistently in this line of work. They just need an easier way to make those changes and ensure they don''t waste trips to job sites, make sure that it''s easy to track changes in the field. If the builder needs additional work that wasn''t originally a part of the plan, just making sure that gets communicated in real time, and just making sure you''re not entering the same information across multiple systems or putting on a whiteboard that gets erased, things like that. Okay. Does that help a little bit? Yeah, and so let me tell you, I mean, and I kind of gathered that because I was, you know, obviously I was Googling and all the wonderful things, resources, just reading the testimonies from your clients. I don''t know specifically that this is really geared toward us, so let me tell you about us. We are a small lawn and landscape company. We do yard maintenance for customers. We aren''t necessarily in line with building, quote unquote. We will go do landscaping after something is built, but as far as the actual construction, we''re not in that line at all. And we work out of QuickBooks, and we''re such a small company that we literally have an admin staff of three, and we use QuickBooks. I''ve been with the company almost two years, not quite. We don''t even use a PO system here. We don''t use POs through QuickBooks, even though I would love to have a procurement process, for the work that happens, it just doesn''t work. We hire a lot of the H-2A workers to do our lawn and landscape work for us. So we have a bit of a, I''m trying to be professional and get my words right here. So we do use a whiteboard for, you know, we have a customer that wants a landscape, that''s what goes on our board, or sod or something like that. Our guys aren''t very technical. There''s language barriers. There''s, what am I trying to say? We write in English, they like to write in Spanish. And so there''s that, you know, that as well. So given that, do you still see that this is something that would be geared toward us? Yes, mostly. There''s still a couple things I want to clarify before we continue like fully. But it''s like this is, so just so you know, you can say and speak your language however you like. I have been in construction since birth. When I was born, my dad had a framing business that he was running. He''s a home builder now, but he has been, I''ve been in and around this industry my entire life. I owned my own construction cleaning business for seven years. So however you say things is totally fine with me. I will understand. And if I don''t understand, I''ll ask. But I''ve also worked with a lot of landscaping companies. And a lot of the things that you just said are pretty much ring true for every landscaping company I''ve talked to. So the language barrier, not a problem. We built this system here in Texas. It was built by an electrician. And he had the exact same concern when he started building software for his company. It''s like, how the heck is this going to work? Our app is Spanish friendly, so it translates the information for your Spanish groups to make it easier for you guys to communicate. Okay. And so if the guys are in the field and they''re, okay, so I guess I should let you just keep going because right now I guess I don''t completely, you know, obviously I don''t understand how the whole thing works. So yeah, you go ahead. Yeah, and we''ll get to the demo and walk you through how the product works and everything. But who are some of your customers? Well, our customers are just residential for the most part. We have, we do the McDonald''s landscaping in the Southeast Texas area. We handle Smurfett Westrock, their EvaDell facility. We do their lawn maintenance and their janitorial services. That, however, might, might would be a different animal within itself, the janitorial, because it''s ran through the customer''s software, which is track. So there''s things that have to be done in there. I don''t really know how that would feed into this. That could actually be part of a different conversation, I guess. But as far as commercial, it''s really just the McDonald''s that we do at this point. We don''t have a lot of commercial activity. We are 98% residential. Okay. And the residential side, are you installing new landscape and sod? Are you doing irrigation? Or are you purely just, hey, like I own my home. I have somebody that comes on a biweekly basis and mows my yard and takes care. And then once a season, they do the remulch. They put flowers down, stuff like that. We do every bit of the above. Okay. So you do new installations. We do new installations. We do, we clean up existing. We do new irrigation. Or we will go repair, replace parts on older or, you know, irrigation systems that we didn''t do. So what percentage, so for those new installations, are those still, are those all directly with the homeowners? Are those with like home builders? Nope. Home owners. Okay. What percentage would you say is new install versus service work? Gosh, we have so many repeat customers until I would venture to say probably 65 to 70%, 75%. And it may be a little bit higher. It just, it varies so much from year to year. But would be our repeat customers. And then everyone else. That''s not ours. That''s y''all''s. It''s going to be new. Okay. And then how many customers do you guys currently have? Currently we probably have 115, 120. He said you''re managing the scheduling aspect all on a whiteboard? Yes, it''s literally the scheduling, it''s very basic because it can''t be complicated, right? I''m going to do a landscape job for you, I''m coming on this day. That''s really the part of it. So yeah, we do it on a whiteboard. It''s split into two parts, the top month, the bottom month, and we write the days on it and these are the days we''re going to be there. Yeah, and how are you communicating that to the crews? The crews get work orders, they get punch lists, and then we talk about it with them as well, but they actually have the physical copies. Y''all have like a morning meeting where you''re like, okay, you guys are going to these jobs, here''s your paperwork? So here''s the process, and these are, let me just say, this is the process. So the owner and his son are the two that really drive the crews. And so the owner, his son, and our estimating scheduler, they meet in the morning, and our nursery manager, they will meet in the mornings to go over previous day''s work, current day work, and then the owner and his son are the ones that are actually communicating with the guys and dictating to them when, where, why, how. They''re the ones making changes, so it''s really those two that are directing the traffic. Gotcha. And another question I have, are you guys, are y''all picking up your materials, your sod, things like that from a yard, or do y''all basically have it all in-house and have your own managing? No, we get that from turf farms. Okay, cool. So what do you think, did he mention why he thought it would be a good idea to explore this system? Anything specific on that front? Yes, and I''m going to be blatantly honest. So in the office of a staff of literally three, I''m the office manager, I do billing, AP, payroll, Kevin''s personal assistant, everything. And then I have a lady that does all the estimating and scheduling, and then we''ve got Kevin and Kyler. So there''s frustrations. If we put a schedule together, but we don''t follow the process to follow that schedule, and changes are made, but that is not communicated across the board, then obviously there''s frustrations that take place, right? So that''s ultimately, in a nutshell, that''s why I''m talking to you, because that seems to happen, and he gets frustrated, and then he talks to his friends, you know, well, this is great, this works, and I''m going, well, they''re also running, you know, $80 million, we''re running six. And I''m not beating us down at all, that''s great for our industry in this area. Oh, yeah. But it''s really, we have the paper, do we need the paper, would it be easier if nobody had paper, if everybody was working off of a, you know, electronically? Well, I don''t know the answer to that, you know, I think there''s limitations with our team to a degree, but is it trainable? Probably. Yeah, and I''ll let you know now, if you guys do decide to partner up with us, and it seems like something that would work for you, we''ll take care of the training aspect. We have that built in on our side. We have an entire team dedicated to ensuring that you get set up properly. So walk me through more of these frustrations. Why are they occurring exactly? Well, a lot of our business, like I said, they''re repeat customers, and so a lot of our customers have, you know, Kevin on speed dial, or they have his phone number, or certain things come up, and so they''ll call Kevin, and they''ll want this done, and he''s moving things around, and he''s busy, and maybe he forgets to tell us, or the information doesn''t come across correctly, and, you know, myself and the estimator and scheduler, Miss Laura, we''re only as good as the information we''re given. So let me give you a little bit of how the process, once they''re on the board, well, just bear with me one second. So a customer calls, and we put the meeting on Kevin''s calendar. He''s the one that actually goes out and meets with the customer. He takes a piece of graph paper with him, and he writes notes in his own way, and he''ll do a very rough sketch of what the conversation is about, how they''re wanting things to look, and, you know, the list of things that they''re wanting, whether it''s stone or mulch or whatever, whatever, whatever, and he brings that back to the office. Now, from that piece of graph paper with his scratch on and his rough sketch, we, my estimator and scheduler, Miss Laura, has to decipher what he''s saying. So we take that, break it down, and build the estimate into QuickBooks off of this piece of graph paper. Now, we created a nice form. You know, we had an operations manager that came on board, created a nice form, asked him to use it. It was rejected right up front. Was not using it, and he still never did. So that is how the process starts. So that in itself is a lot of frustration. When he is seeing four to five people a day, and he''s 30 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and it''s very rough. It takes a lot of time to figure out what he''s trying to tell us sometimes. And a lot of times it''s not complete. You know, we''re constantly having to ask him questions. Well, what is this? And if you want this, then where''s it at on the drawing? And you know what I mean? It''s just a lot of back and forth. That in itself is probably the biggest thorn with the upfront process, getting it from the paper into the system. And then, you know, once it goes to the customer, once it''s an estimate, it goes to the customer, then it''s volleying back and forth with them. Well, I don''t like this. I want to change this. I want to add this, yada, yada, whatever. And then among that, we have to make sure that all these changes that the customer is making is getting into their file, into QuickBooks, and to the guys. You know, because we don''t want to leave anything out, obviously. So herein lies the frustration. You know, something''s getting missed because somebody''s not telling us something, or, you know, we''re not deciphering correctly, or this was forgotten on the list, or, you know, you didn''t understand them correctly. They asked for this, but they didn''t know what they were asking for, that whole thing. Who''s managing those changes? Is that also Kevin, or is that whoever''s building the estimate? At what point? Well, you said that, so Kevin goes out there, does the chicken scratch doctor''s handwriting to pull it together with the customers trying to, like, communicate. He then brings that back to you guys in the office. Somebody creates an estimate out of that information in QuickBooks, and then the estimate goes back to the customer, right? Correct. And then the customer is going to make changes because they don''t know what they''re asking for. They have no clue what the heck landscaping even means, so then things are just getting moved around. Is that, who''s the changes in that process being communicated to? Is that going to Kevin back to you guys again, or is that going directly to the estimator? That''s going, it''s ultimately, I mean, oh my gosh, initially it''s going to the estimator, Ms. Laura, my clerk that puts them together. However, we typically have to run them by Kevin just to make sure that it will work. You know, they may have a small spot and they want, you know, an oak tree, but they don''t realize that that oak tree gets 50 foot tall. You know what I mean? So it goes to Laura first. If it''s something, you know, because we do it so much, a lot of times she can say, oh, well, that will work. Ultimately, it''s your house. You can do what you want, but, you know, let me run it by Kevin to make sure that it''s going to work there or see if there''s an alternative to that for you. So between Laura and Kevin, it really bounces back and forth until the customer says, okay, I approve that. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I really appreciate you just painting the picture for me and telling me how this process gets communicated because every time I talk to a landscaper, this is one of the more chaotic processes within their business is how this all unfolds. Yeah, it''s crazy. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so the estimate gets done and you and the customer agree that this is the plan. What are the next steps from there? Okay, so once we agree that they pay their deposit and we schedule them on our board, our calendar, and they are notified, hey, we''re coming out in two weeks. You know, we''re going to be there in the morning or the afternoon. And so we get to that point the day before we print or the week of, we print all the work orders for the guys. We put them in their boxes so that they can familiarize themselves with, you know, what''s going on. In between that, you know, someone''s pulling the plants. You know, there''s things, once the estimate is approved, we make sure we have those plants on site in the nursery or that they''ve been ordered so that, you know, everything''s ready for the job. And then the week of, the work orders are printed and they''re given to the guys. And then we walk through the rest of that process. And then after the job''s completed, then you bill the rest, the remaining amount? That is correct. Once the job is completed, the guys have a foreman''s report that they fill out that because just because we bid 15 yards of mulch doesn''t mean we''re going to use that much. So the foreman''s report is the actual finalized number for the product or material being used. And once they bring that foreman''s report in after the job is completed, then Laura, if need be, will modify those quantities and then she will send the final invoice. And that''s all done through QuickBooks? Correct. Cool. Okay. And then are there ever changes that come up whenever your guys go out to the, are on the job? Every single day. Every day. Every day. How are those being communicated and tracked? So most of the time they''re on site, customer walks out, hey, can you add or can you do, they''ll call into the office to Laura and say, hey, she''s wanting to add or she''s wanting to do. And so, you know, Laura''s making note of that. In the meantime, we''ve got somebody coming back to the yard to pick up whatever it is that they''re wanting to add and take it to the site so that it can be done at that time. Do they ever not call Laura and they just do it? Yes. Yes. If it''s, you know, if they''ve taken, well, not even if they''ve taken extra, there are times when the customer will ask for something and, you know, Kyler, you know, will come back, grab it and take it. And then after the fact, you know, it''s on the foreman''s report and she''s like, well, what is this? It wasn''t on the estimate. Well, they wanted it, you know, when we got there or she said this before we left. Yeah, that happens a lot. Does it ever not make it on the foreman''s report? Yes. Yeah. Yes. All right. Yes. And I think it''s probably just in, you know, everybody''s trying to do what, you know, what we''ve got laid out and it''s just in the middle of it and they just, you know, forget to write it down or, you know, it''s just not accounted for or whatever, but it''s not often, but it does happen. Anything else going on just in the general process? No, I mean, that''s because once it gets to the point of the final invoice being sent to the customer, then it''s, you know, then it''s just accounts receivable collecting on that invoice. And then the process just starts over, you know. Now, once the one thing that we do that I request just from a financial perspective and the way QuickBooks handles things is if we create an estimate and the customer approves that estimate and we collect the deposit on that estimate, then if they call a couple of days later and say, oh, well, I want to add such and such or I want you to give me a quote on such and such, then I have Laura go in and create a whole new estimate because we''ve already applied a payment to that specific transaction because the way QuickBooks works is once it''s been approved and accepted, then it has to be converted to an actual invoice. So once it becomes an actual invoice, then it starts hitting my financials. And so if I apply a payment to it, but then you go in and you start adding to it, then things are wonky. So we do have, you know, those instances where we''ve already started this estimate. Oh, well, now I want to add this, but we just do it as a completely new estimate just to keep the books clean. Other than those pieces, it''s really, really that. That is the hiccup in the whole process. To me, it''s not even the whiteboard. You know, it''s not that. It''s communication for number one. And then, you know, well, I guess communication is really it across the board because if anything is changed and it''s not communicated to Laura, then she doesn''t know to revise it. If the guys do something in the field and doesn''t tell Laura or Kyler or myself, then again, here we are, you know, chase and tell. Well, what I can tell you is that landscapers pretty much across the board all have a service component to their business, whether they work with production builders or not. Service is always gonna be a big part of landscaping more so than pretty much any other trade I work with just because it''s really, really easy to like basically put, install landscapes and then build a relationship with the customer and retain that business as a regular business, right? Right, right. And we, the landscapers I''ve worked with have been very successful using our system for the things that you''re describing, especially when it comes to communication breakdowns because whenever you change something in the system, it changes on a global scale. So if Kevin needs to reschedule a job in the field from the mobile app, that''s gonna automatically update on your schedules in the office. But we can also, again, pictures and documentation. We can put these forms that you guys are using to build your estimates. We can template that out in our system so that Kevin can just draw on a PDF in our app, make the notes, check off boxes, send that to you guys. We even have talk-to-text, which I think is what we would push him to use. He would not, I can tell you. He won''t do it. He won''t click a button and just talk to the phone rather than typing. No, I''m sure he will not. Hey, you know what? There''s a first time for everything, and he may prove me 100% wrong. Well, I find it interesting that he would push you to take a look at a software system, but he''s not willing to use the software. Yeah, no, I completely agree. Yeah, I mean, we brought an operations manager on board to identify efficiencies or inefficiencies, and he ain''t here no more. And I''m just being, I mean, I am very black and white. There''s no gray area, you know, so I''m not about to waste your time or anything, so I want you to know what it is. I would love to know who he talked to who pushed him toward this, because that would help me a lot in just being like, I mean, I can tell you, whoever you talk to is using the system this way, and they''re successful because of it. And I will definitely try to find out. But you know what? Let''s say for the sake of argument that he says, okay, I''ll do that. I''ll use talk to text. I use talk to text every single day of my life, and it''s great. It saves me a lot of keystrokes. Saves me a lot of time. We have this really cool ability. So in the mobile app, you can have documents, right, and you can edit these documents. And there''s a specific thing you can do where you can actually, on that document, you can record a voice note, right? So if he''s drawing and doing his little things with his pencil on his iPad, he can record a voice note rather than like jotting all of this down like freehand. And then you guys in the office would just have to listen to his voice rather than try to read what he''s trying to put down. Yeah, almost like dictation. Absolutely. That would be great. Yeah. And I feel like he''s got to be able to do that for you guys more so than for himself. So let me ask you this. Okay, so say we do this, and I know that you said that the translation, and this is a big thing on my mind because all of our guys, we have a couple that can speak decent English, but they don''t always understand English so well. So if they''re in the field and they do a note and they do it, you know, speaking the note, and that comes across, we''re able to hear that in English? That translation works like that? No, I''m really hoping that we get to a point where like this new AI kick will allow us to start incorporating stuff like that because it''s pretty close. There''s some cool stuff happening with artificial intelligence. But right now we haven''t incorporated that or it''s not there yet from a technological standpoint. When it comes to like translation is one, there''s a couple different ways to look at this. One, we can have it to where all the hard-coded fields in our app translate to Spanish so that it''s easy for them to navigate. And then on the flip side, we''re also putting a lot of like we''re templating out a lot of things so that your guys don''t have to put in as many notes. They just have to click buttons, right? So when we build out forms or whatnot, it''s less of them having to jot notes down and more of them just saying, yes, I did this. No, this wasn''t there. So like a drop-down box. Exactly. And that''s something we put into Spanish so that it''s... Okay, so it''s put in Spanish. Okay, okay. I was going to say, okay, so if they check this box, I used four blue plumbagos and 16 foxtail ferns, and they put that in English because their numbers, it''s crazy. It''s not always in English. So as long as when we get it in the office, we''re able to see it in English and it''s correct, then that would be great. Yeah, because we have about 65 companies in Texas alone and then companies through New Mexico, Arizona, California, and we have no issue with the Spanish-English communication. Okay, that''s awesome. Awesome. Okay, that''s good. Any other questions? So this... Product communicates with QuickBooks. So how would that work? So would we still maintain QuickBooks for billing and all of that, or is this a replacement of QuickBooks? No, it''s not a replacement. We are not an accounting system. We do everything from the start of a project to up into billing, right? So we can create invoice drafts out of Bolt. You can manage your contracts and your items, like how much we''re going to charge for this. You can basically, for your situation, build an estimate in our system. And then when it comes time to bill on that final estimate, you could push the information from Bolt to QuickBooks so you''re not doing duplicate data entry. Okay, so... Because right now there''s a lot of manual data entry on how you are doing things today. Yes, because the company''s never been... It is in my short-term goal to get us to a P2P process, but right now it''s far from there. Number one, I don''t have the staff, and number two, change is hard. And pushing anything, I''ve got to have my ducks in a row when I approach it. We do... Yeah, so anyway. Okay, so the estimate... Go ahead. I think there are some really complex features in our system that we can get to in time, but what I would probably recommend is we start really basic and solve this communication piece and see if we can just make it easy for you, Kevin, and everybody else to get on the same page. Yes, yeah. And if we can accomplish that, I think that''s a massive benefit to the company. All the other stuff, we can address in implementation as you guys get more comfortable with the system itself. Okay, so let me back up for just a second so I understand. So the estimate process, Kevin has his tablet or whatever. Is it a tablet or is it just his phone? It could be a tablet or a phone. I would probably recommend a tablet for the fact that he''s drawing. Just give him more real estate to work with. But if he has a phone, we can make that work. Okay, so he has his device. He goes to the customer. So we put the customer database into... Or is he actually signing on to Bolt, which is tied to QuickBooks and our customer information is feeding across from there? Or how does the customer information get... Let me back up. My brain is getting ahead of my mouth. No, you''re good. I know where you''re going, and I can explain it to you, but it''s going to be a lot easier to look at it from a visual perspective. Okay. And I think I''m confident that we can help you guys out at this, based on everything you''ve told me, your process, the challenges within your process. I think it would be best to schedule out a demo. Okay. My teammate Chrissy is our product expert. She demos Bolt. My job is just to make sure all your questions get answered and kind of just manage this process that we''re in. But the next step from here would be to schedule out that demo so you can take a look at it. I would probably say just keep it to you for now. Okay. If you like what you see, you think it''s something that could work for the team, let''s schedule out a second demo with the rest of the team once you''re confident. Okay, yeah. What do you think? Yeah, that sounds great. I think there''d be mass confusion if we did it any other way. Cool. And then you can also, like, if you like it, you can also guide us and be like, okay, let''s maybe not get too deep on this process. Let''s focus more on this thing when we talk with Kevin, stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Cool. So I am out of town next week for that vacation. Okay. Would you be okay scheduling something for, like, the first week of June? Yeah, that''s perfectly fine. Next week is actually month-end for me, so not just month-end, quarter-end, month-end. So I''ll be kind of busy next week anyway. Okay. What day would work best for you that week? Let me see. Hang on one second. Okay. I''ll tell you what, because that first week of June is a payroll week for me, can we do it the week of the 9th? Like, that Tuesday the 10th would be okay. Okay. I''m going to make a note to give you a shout that Monday just to make sure nothing has come up crazy. Okay. But let''s go ahead and put something tentative on for that Tuesday. What time specifically would work best for you? If we could do around two, the afternoons seem to be a little bit better for me than the mornings. Chrissy, you have a dentist appointment at 2.30? Can we do one o''clock? Yeah, one will be fine. One will be great. All right. I will get that demo sent out, and then I''ll get Chrissy notes from this conversation so that she''s fully prepped up to address a lot of what we talked about, and we''ll just kind of go from there. Okay, awesome. Tim, thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing what you guys got. Yeah, I appreciate all the information. I love how you walked me through your company and just all the details of it. It''s awesome. Yeah, and that''s just high level. Wait till you really see it. You guys are an incredibly complex organization, but I work with landscapers all the time. Okay, well, that''s great. I''ll be honest. You are my second favorite trade to work with. Oh, wow. Okay, awesome. Plumbing is my favorite. Really? Yeah. Wow. It''s the most complex trade type out there, and just every single business is so incredibly different for the exact same kind of trade, but I''ve worked with more plumbing companies than I''ve worked with any trade at this point. Landscapers are definitely up there as well, though. Oh, gosh. Wow. Okay, well, I look forward to it, and I really thank you for your time and your knowledge and expertise and listening. For sure. Yeah, no, I mean, that''s the only way this thing works, right? Right, right. There''s a lot of BS software out there, and we''re just trying to make sure that we don''t rope anybody around. Right. Well, let me ask you just a ballpark high-level question. Go in the direction that we were talking, just getting us to where the mass confusion is less confusion. Ballpark average, what does this run roughly? How many total employees do you have? That would be using the program or company-wide? We''ll probably have a better idea of who''s going to use the program once we get to the demo. You''ll have a much better idea of who needs to have access to it, but how many people in office do you guys have? Altogether, we probably have about 40. 40 total employees? Yeah. And then do you subcontract any work? It''s kind of seasonal, so in the wintertime we may have less because, again, all of our lawn and landscape, I don''t want to say all, but 22 of them are H-2A visa workers, so they all go home in November. So, yeah, but during peak season, February to October, November, we''re running about 40. Okay. I''d say we''d probably be in the ballpark of $1,000 to $1,500 a month with that user count. It could be more, it could be less. Again, you''ll have a much better idea of how many people need to have access to the system once you get an idea of how everything functions, but my recommendation is you definitely want everybody in the office to have access to the system. Any field supervisors, Kevin for sure, and then typically your crew leads will have access so that you have somebody that''s able to clock crews in, take pictures, stuff like that. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, that''s still going to be a pretty good number, but yeah, we can definitely look at that. I mean, obviously later, but that''s a good ballpark to have because he''ll ask, you know, so I can at least say roughly, you know, given certain dynamics or whatever, this is apt to change. Yeah, and just so you know, all of our pricing is based on users. There''s a flat fee for the software system, and then there''s a user fee, and then we do have an implementation and training fee, and there''s three different packages you guys can choose from on that front. Oh, okay, okay. Okay, well, perfect, perfect. All right, well, I look forward to the demo. Awesome. I''m looking forward to just seeing if we can help you guys out and everything. Awesome. All right, Tim, well, you enjoy your vacation and the holiday, and congratulations to you and your wife. I appreciate it. Enjoy your long weekend, all right? You too. All right, bye-bye. Thanks, bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
The conversation between Tim from Bolt Software and Sabrina from Southern Lawn and Landscape focused on exploring whether Bolt''s software solution could address operational inefficiencies in Sabrina''s landscaping business. Tim provided an overview of the software''s capabilities, while Sabrina detailed her company''s processes, challenges, and needs. The discussion concluded with plans to schedule a demo to evaluate the software further.

**Key Points:**  
• **Overview of Bolt Software:**  
Tim explained that Bolt is a software designed for trade contractors, centralizing processes like scheduling, document management, and communication. The system includes a mobile app for real-time updates and integrates with QuickBooks for billing.  

• **Southern Lawn and Landscape''s Current Challenges:**  
Sabrina described inefficiencies in communication, scheduling, and project management. Key pain points include reliance on manual processes (e.g., whiteboards, paper-based notes), language barriers with field workers, and inconsistent communication of changes between the field and office.  

• **Next Steps and Demo Scheduling:**

Hey, Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about JobBoss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? JobBoss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, JobBoss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do coating for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with JobBoss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. So. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where are we gonna go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s gonna get, it''s gonna grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, a deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like, I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. So as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, it comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know, like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of material, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. Yeah. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have in the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Jobshop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location in- Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs and I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might''ve been the name that he said. So very possible. Well, let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. I''ll just type in as we were talking too so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay, well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay, thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay, you too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

How''s everybody doing over there? Yeah, TGIF, it''s been a week Anywhere with its own year, I''m pretty sure so Are you guys? I''m sorry. Are you guys in st. Louis for Jeff City? Stay at Lewis. Yeah Yeah, I was actually in Jeff City most of the week but back in the office today, there you go, yeah Hey Robert. Good afternoon Hey, good afternoon Jeff I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know you there''s several people invited I''ll just let you you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off Okay, I''m not sure Who all is available on our end? Robert thanks for hopping on. I think Andrews in another meeting and I''m not sure about David So it might just be us Yeah, just know that we are we''re using fathom We''re recording it so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join Cool can watch at their leisure. So Thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call evolution X It''s uh, you guys have been going down this path a little bit trying to work with a Vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already. That''s fully vetted Everything that you''re looking to have in the solution. I think we have for you guys. So We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you Jace EJ''s on the phone CJ comes from evolution X. I''m your account manager from the automate standpoint. I''m from just be, Missouri Been doing this 39 years. So happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well But anyway, CJ is going to kind of go over the product in a little high-level Please ask questions This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward So with that I''m gonna turn over to you CJ Yeah, so Chrissy Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team Really extensively last year and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo but would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on evolution X like who we are or How we work any of that type of stuff or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just The cliff notes, I mean, I''ll give you 30,000 if you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So evolution X e-commerce is a b2b e-commerce software It''s been around about 17 years And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago and it was just because they had enough Customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that see I build an integration if it just made sense for them to buy us and so Now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates Division and customer base and so we''ve had several customers I don''t know throughout the last six months beginning to onboard and it''s been a lot of fun So just think of this as a robust b2b e-commerce software that would compete with any big-box player out there but we''re bringing it to the Small medium-sized distributor within the ECI family awesome I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this So this demos for you guys stop me anywhere we can pivot I''m definitely gonna be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform But this is the flow that I''m gonna go through I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like we''ll give you a back-end overview and I''ll make a change on the home page of my website So you can see like what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage? some search functionality Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded You''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results Some marketing tools and then I will log in as a customer at the end So you can get a feel for what that''s gonna look like for your customers Okay So I pulled a few customer examples here Is that? Yes, sorry Okay, sorry misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here We design these in-house for you guys So the way this would work if you decide to go with evolution X Our design team consults with you and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do No custom design. We can go a few different routes and I''ve pulled examples of each. So this is a fully custom home page For a dealer that''s in the office supply space they also sell some Technology and other products as well But I think from a design perspective we can make this look any way you want it to look some people have a vision for What this drop-down might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side a Lot of different ways we can look to go about this But I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology any category of products They should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for So in this instance, you know, we''ll just go to printers You If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees we can have as many or as few of these as you want But again, ideally these customers are gonna be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website What if they? Excuse me. What if they have a skew and know? Exactly The product that they''re yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable 100% so that''s where some of the search capability will come into play where if you want them to be able to search by the product number reference number That can be done any way you guys want Well, we''ll have full flexibility over the search bar Okay, so it can even like index the description for I put in you know, Dell 14-inch 256 gig it''s gonna go Hey, there''s five results that have those words in the description. Okay? Yeah, it would pull up in the description the category the attributes whatever fields we need to pull it from. Absolutely So I''ll death I''ll look to show you a few different ways. We could leverage the search bar But that''s certainly one of them now looking at Less custom design this website one of our out-of-the-box themes So at a base level we have some templates or themes We call them that we can spin up and essentially we would put your color scheme your branding your logo We would put media in here from you guys or we can supply it But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like If you want to have a shop by brand Banner running across the site So Anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has unique design CJ just a quick question going back to the search searching functionality One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example It doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description Did I hear you say that Evo X actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely keywords attributes So you can go back on any given product and there''s a field where you can say We call it keywords But if you type in a keyword and associated with that product, it means that line of products will pop up Whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it Okay, and this I think is important to note I Say that we''re a white glove service, but it''s your arm and arm is probably the more accurate way to say it You''re gonna have a really good customer success team helping you build this website a lot of this is We''re gonna train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future We don''t want to stand in your way, but if you do want help with these things You''ll have live chat support from us You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to and search the way you want so But ideally we''re gonna help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live that way The search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little sub menus would pop up so Just giving you a feel for from possibilities I think we can design anything you guys would want but this will be something to think about Jeff and all of you as we go down this road if you do want customization We''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team that way they can make Recommendations and hear what you''re looking for and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. So Now something way less glamorous is my demo store I designed this so don''t judge me And I wouldn''t be the one designing your website But I''ll use this just to navigate and move some stuff around and go through the demo Let me see I''m actually gonna log out of my user and I''ll log back into him in a second Okay Back into the website. So when you guys log in this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective You''ll have access to some basic API and data reports. It''s it''s surface level there''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you but At surface level see order conversions how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly weekly basis You can drag and drop them with any of this around Chat support again We do chat support US and UK hours So it''s not quite 24-7, but it''s close and these are actual solutions experts Not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem So if you have an issue you can chat our team I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me and they can grab your screen send you articles jump on a call This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform If you see a new button somewhere, this is the new feature. We''ve added we add features monthly We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that And I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool So most Dealers would have us I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform and we can still do that if you want But it can be overkill for a lot of people so we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into evolution X so you can come in here and See how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at who''s the top users You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website how it''s trending And I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant Search results So this will be again Giving you data on when people come to your site. What keywords are they actually typing into the search bar? You might have something that is in your top ten It''s unexpected Well when someone types that in you''re gonna want to make sure that the right products are popping up as we''ve discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything? We''ve shown at this point? Are you able to slice those? Oh, sorry Yeah, I was gonna say are you able to slice those? Analytics down to like a from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day Yep up here. Okay. Yeah, and you can make it a custom range if you if you awesome So That''s good. What else Jeff? Did you have a question? Yeah from the design perspective. I''m curious of your approach is From our perspective. Do we create like a wireframe and give that to you guys? So you kind of know what to go from or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times your designers? Put together some options and then we you know, go through the approval process and editing process. Yeah, it can go either way I don''t think it hurts to have a wireframe But you don''t need one and our team is definitely not accustomed to having one so see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it then Certainly that helps but most people don''t Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you and then we do go through an iterative process So we''ll make a draft Based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting and then we might have to revise it three or four times Okay So no standard practice But what I''ll show you next the Jefferson is once we build you this site You''re gonna have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes. And so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I Use this jump to button in the top left just because it''s quicker to get around I''m gonna type in layouts So after the site is built this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website I''m gonna go into the home page So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform, but you don''t have to most of this is meant to be drag-and-drop no code and So we house all of the media content in these tiles that we call widgets For example, I have a media gallery tile if I open it up I have an image of this, you know office room if I go to And let me log out of this user if I go to the home page of my website and scroll down That image is right here on my website. So I just uploaded this from my desktop Into this widget. I don''t need to know code Now if I didn''t want to take it and say resize it or I wanted to switch it to the other side of the website You can kind of see all these boxes moving around in a very drag-and-drop format So this is kind of the general concept of moving stuff around what it looks like all that good stuff Now what I am gonna do On my website I have Some items for sale we call this an item merchandiser and it says new products Maybe it''s the end of the month You''ve got a sale going on and you want to highlight that and make it the first thing people see when they go to your website I Would come into this item merchandising widget and open it up I''ll change the title to end of month Specials if you want different living breathing list of product groups in here, you can have them If you want to change how fast the carousel is running you can make it, you know, two seconds versus three seconds But I''ll just save my changes and I''ll take this up to the top of my website Resize it save and publish Cool now if I go back to my website and hit refresh that''s gonna be a real-time change So now you''ll see the end of month specials carousel Hitting my website And I could probably do that in less than a minute if I wasn''t talking So Jeff would that mainly be you or would Yeah, most likely I''ll be the one administering the site perfect so Any questions about what it looks like to make a look and feel change or just any design oriented stuff from that perspective? from the rest of the team now flexibility and options Yeah, CJ one of the things that I do recall from a previous demo was how how you showcase How we could feature specific brands or specific products. So for example right now We''re we''re kind of doing a special on Dyna book, right? So yeah for the recording for the folks that couldn''t be with us Would you mind just talking about how we can highlight? Certain brains or certain products and then run specials on those products And then I remember even saying you could connect to the product listing to like a blog article on on such a product So would you mind just explaining to the team, please? Absolutely. So a few different ways you can leverage the search results from maximizing brands or categories of products The first point being if you wanted them to search a part number skew reference number you could do it that way Another example, my demo store is set up to where if I type in copy paper And I know this is an office supplies example, but you''ll get the point. I Type in coffee paper copy paper. I have my evolution X copy paper showing up first. This is ambitious margins I''m shooting for three hundred fifty dollars, but you get the point and I''ve got a banner displaying that Hey 45% off right and so that''s the general idea now the way we set this is pretty straightforward on The back end. There''s a feature called brand priority Again our team will help you guys set this up before for the site goes live So you won''t be alone and figuring this out But all I do is come in here and choose the brand that I''m looking to influence. I''ll just do 3m And I could say I want 3m to be number one or number ten Maybe you hate them and you want to bury them in the search results We''ll say we want them to be number one. And then you would just open up what catalog we''re pulling from. I think it''s important to note we have a Good amount of catalogs built into evolution X So if you''re an approved vendor with distributor network or a TD Cinex or Ingram We can spin those up and then you would just go Select The catalog and I''ll say technology warranties I want 3m to be the number one brand that pops up for this category And so that''s one way you can influence brands. It''s pretty straightforward Another would be Just see if I type in coffee maker I Have a Media banner displaying above products. So yes, I typed in copy maker It''s pulling up all the copy makers, but I have a bun copy banner displaying about the products So if somebody clicked that it would take me directly to those products. There''s another way you can Go about Influencing the search results or the cut the customer journey as well You could get I want to see if I have this let me see stapler I was gonna say maybe staplers I''ve seen some people do it where Maybe it''s not a brand but it''s a category like in this like if I typed in staplers Maybe it pulls up desktop staplers instead of I Don''t know like a heavy-duty stapler, so it may not be a brand maybe it''s a category you want showing up first But Jeff to your point what we see people doing More and more is called guided selling and so I think in your industry We see this being valuable just from educating the customer on how to buy your products So this is a furniture example But you''ll get the point of how this could relate to what you''re wanting to do If I''m on this customer''s website codex, and I''m looking for desk options I can get to the products But it also has this block above the products that will educate me on how to select the best office desk How to make sure it''s the correct height how to choose the right size and to Jeff''s point you''ll notice that throughout this blog links to cross-sell items that would be compatible with an office desk so you can go big or small with this type of concept, but essentially Guiding the customer towards purchasing a certain products, and then when I click office desks. It''s giving me the same type of experience But eventually I can actually get to the product that I''m looking for What questions y''all have looking at that You So I love that for the new customers the people that are new and fresh to the site Honestly though also we will have customers where there''s an expectation of consistent repeat business One of the customers for example that we''re trying to set this up for Does have an e-commerce spend on? Technology hardware in the seven-figure range so For them we want to make it a very convenient user experience can we talk just a little bit about how we could set up like favorites and reorders and kind of making that convenient for like Purchases for people that are kind of reordering the same things or bundles, and if they can be on a per customer absolutely So what I''m about to show you you guys will be able to do On the back end. I''m gonna go pull up some made-up accounts that I have so theoretically This would be the accounts that are on here if you want certain people in your company to only have access to certain accounts That''s very doable But I have CJ''s Furniture Co is a made-up account before I log in just to show you you''ll have some data at the the Organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history You can track their spent and the trajectory of that their search history the top users all of that stuff But I''ll go log as a user here So I have myself made up as an account and I''m gonna go log in on my profile So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do and I''m showing you right now you could do that You can target promotions to people specifically Just to take a step back I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer so This is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion Based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The home page of your website could look totally different as well But when your customers log in this is the portal experience that they''re gonna have on your website There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do but you can put their logo Or may log in instead of your logo. Theirs is gonna show up at the top of the website Obviously their user profile you can put their headshot They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history They could quickly just click view Get into a recent order in it email it or just click reorder all and all those items will be added to the cart So that''s one way They could do a quick reorder They have multiple saved carts, they''ll be able to view that multiple credit cards if two scenarios if They have a budget assigned to them by their boss This is where they can come in and check the status of their budget the balance remaining Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders or If they''re the person that has to approve the orders those would all filter in the orders to approve field but They''ll have access to some surface level stuff here. And then when they click their name This side menu is going to come up If you want to do rewards points you can do stuff like that like a Traditional e-commerce type of feature but a quick list would be what I think you called like a favorites list Mm-hmm. So if I was a sales rep, I can go in and build these for my customers or the customer could do it themselves But ideally if every time I have to restock the copy room I buy the same things I would just put those items on a quick list The quantities could be preset or a customer can just check a box and say add items to the cart These can be set up on recurring order if they buy the same things on the same days of every month No challenges with any of that Mm-hmm and all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process TJ quick question going back to the approver relationship Is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an an automated email to the approver? When when one of his employees Submits an order Yeah, absolutely. So this is where You will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say for example I''m a CFO and you made me a super admin user They could set this up or again you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want and so under advanced settings or approval settings And I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load Oh, there we go, so This is where they would come in and sit there There''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want and then this trigger the email to your point so if they wanted to Track by cost center. So maybe they want to track spend by department if they wanted to create budgets for specific users they could come in and do that here and if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month Anything above that''s going to acquire approval. They would save those settings Then what we do on the back end We have Email templates that can be customized and we would just associate that template with that account for that event So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens We would just tie an email template to that workflow So Does that answer the question? Yep, that does and in case you guys hear the alarms. We''re just doing our testing today So it''s not like what you know code red or anything. Okay I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it Okay. Yeah, we can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I''m gonna say it''s probably inconvenient for you Was the ice cream truck? So you''re doing a good job of got me Jeff there''s these are all the things that normally would show but I want to keep This relevant to you. So what other things are we not hit on that? You guys have questions about or want to see? If so, we have the The The capability to take credit cards through I guess the stripe platform and Then we also have the option on here to accept There for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is assuming Craig Well, are y''all using that one? I? Know One We''re currently using stripe to accept credit card payments But I think to further Chrissy''s question We''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with e automate from kind of an accounting perspective Got it. So the short answer is yes, we can in it like I''ll show you the App Store You can certainly use stripe my store is actually set up with stripe, but This is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services HubSpot is a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here, but Ideally, I don''t know Craig can probably answer your questions about net one on a separate call But if you wanted customers to obviously use net one or paid up using ACH Those are things that can be done as well, but stripe very doable Okay, Chrissy I''ll have some I get with you Chrissy on the net one side because the majority of our clients do use net one and interfaces with the automate integrates I mean and also your customer II info for using that so It''s a to me. It''s a no-brain must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate wise and get you what those percentages would be But um, yeah, let me get you in touch with them guys Okay, great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not a Hundred percent what it would look like. This is a different ERP, but Just on the customer portal and when we do integrate this to you automate there will be an invoice history tab Typically these fields are clickable when it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP so if they wanted to actually, you know hyperlink and click into that they could see it, but It will pull the invoice history on and offline orders So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still gonna pull that invoice history for them to 24 7 Okay, so that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I didn''t I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal Okay, i''m confused I actually have two questions cj one of which is is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about Do customers shoppers have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy. You said you wanted to show us how to do that To the product listing yeah, uh, so we''ll show that chrissy you said you''re confused Yeah, can you just Recap this page that you''re on again. Yep You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect so evolution x integrates with 30 different erp systems Oh, okay. So e automate is one we work with a number of different Uh, so the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to e automate for that reason so I have a demo store that has some fake data To where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in they will have an invoice history tab So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website Yep, okay, I get it the data that looks yeah It doesn''t look exactly the same as what the automate data will look like because this is fake data just to give you an idea of what it would look like they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up, but Anyway, we''re going to feed all order. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history and And the reason that''s relevant is maybe again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you But it can still access their invoice history without having to call you right so it''s going to pull all orders on and offline Nice, that''s awesome um Now your question i''ll show you sorry. I''m circle back to that one, so Um, i''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart So this is where again like if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item I could just Open it up So Sorry, what are you about to ask? What was I gonna ask Sorry. Oh, yeah. No, it''s all good I I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps and I heard mail chimp in there as well Just curious about the integration of things like connect wise or salesforce Or kaseya or or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have uh integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s kind of here''s what this looks like Evolution x is open api. So technically we can integrate with any third-party app If we don''t have an existing integration It may take some dev work so there may be just be a cost associated with that And salesforce would be a big one like we could integrate salesforce and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it and so I think there''s a business case there but the Salesforce is also very different for every company The way we use salesforce at eci might be very different than you guys and so it just takes a little bit of The answer is yes But there would be a dev cost associated with it and I couldn''t even tell you what that is Those kind of are done case by case Okay But the capability is there? Yeah We can we can''t do it. So the platform is is built to integrate Okay and so for for guest users we can You know hide published pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog A thousand percent You can customize this. Okay Yep, based off of what their role is and it''s all check boxes for the most part Like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing you would just uncheck a box Um What about uh, like margin and markup rules i''m assuming we can do that per company per customer. Can we do it? But Like how complicated can we get with the rules? Like can we say hey do 20 percent unless that puts it over msrp Things like that So that''s typically data we pull from e-automate So if you''re talking just at a basic level right like uh, you could call it contract pricing Every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product That''s all data that we pull real time from e-automate now you could you could do it in evolution x as well um Just in order some erps are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website it has to match something you have in the rp2 for it to like push over correctly, but The answer is yes. I don''t know if i''m making sense on that explanation I i''m not an ema automate user So I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of e-automate on our set At a basic level the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing 100 that is I would say a table stakes feature of evolution x Um What other questions do you guys have I can show you the blog feature if you mentioned that the ai block, uh, I don''t know jeff. That might just be your thing, but How are you? It is i''ll probably be be supporting it a little bit But I think it it''s exciting for the other uh people on the call to just see how we can truly write Reinforce the the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah, two things i''ll show you something That is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer and both are pretty cool. So I Feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other e-commerce products in the market And I do think we''re doing the most with ai and this is the first thing we did about a year ago where Uh, give me a blog title anybody benefits of what What''s a break? Wi-fi Go for it Go for it robert, uh benefits of wi-fi six Wi-fi six like this. Yep Cool. Okay. I''ll type in the title. You can make the tone professional casual funny. We''ll do funny You can adjust the word length ask evo xai and it''s going to start to spit out your blog for you Now you''re going to want to proofread it but it The results it does spit out are pretty remarkable Ideally, it''s trying to take away 70 percent of the lead time of writing a blog now Once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look It will do the excerpt for you It will do the meta information for search engine optimization And kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating The buyer on how to buy office furniture If you wanted to link products into the blog, this is just where you would come in and I''m, just going to type in random numbers You would type in the skew part number the name whatever and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog so That''s just one example Chat gpt is baked in here, too So if you needed ideas for a blog title, you could just you could type that in and have it give you ideas Ideas So that''s current state, but I will show you I think I have some slides here in this deck Yes, here we go, so we are adding co-pilot to the platform we have some customers in data testing right now But this will be a full Ai assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well And jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this because it''s It''s pretty new but In this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month? It pulled that data you tell it to create a 10 discount code for those items and name it best sellers of the month So it will go do that for you. And then you say can you Essentially, can you make a marketing page? Based off of these best sellers don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you That you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website That''s insane, that''s awesome Yeah, so i''ve got a few examples in this, uh slide deck But I think you get the point like any business data you want to pull Um gross revenue or if you wanted to have extend contracts as an example This will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys and that''s again we''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but This is the direction it''s going So Lots of cool stuff with ai Yeah Another question that is probably important to talk about is is deal registration Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m, not craig might be but yeah, fill me in Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure So a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers. They want to be able to forecast it And so they will do partner initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing Okay, those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days And once we have that by saying hey customer abc is going to buy a hundred dell laptops over the next six months They go cool. That''s awesome Your new price for them is this Okay, and ideally it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool And so what''s your thought on like what are you wanting to do with that information on the e-commerce platform? Well, I mean we we pass, you know Some of the savings along but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time There''s there''s not much in the it Marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup You''re always going to end up with these these deal regs and big deal pricing type stuff Got it. So i''m going to show you I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting So It''s not just the pricing but you''re wanting to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain time frame Um, I believe so yeah, like if we could have something like your price which is good through You know march 31st or something like that Okay so Two thoughts on this and i''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do so The first thing you could do is make a promotion In the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example I could say 10 off February and I you again like this is a generic title, but you this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and the stop dates for the promotion So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates You could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer And then you would select a promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting a dollar amount off or a percentage off Which would be hey within these dates. You''ve got a 10 discount It''s going to generate a coupon code Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe Only I don''t know five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend 300 to qualify None of this might be relevant to your Example but you can set rules and conditions and then Whatever promotion you''re running you would just apply it across a group of products Okay, you apply that to a specific customer though because these are customer specific Yes, you can apply and i''m assuming you can do it without the coupon to where they just see the better pricing and know it''s Big deal pricing or whatever. Yep when they log in you might have to display a So to a few ways you could approach that right like yes when they go in Like there be a there could be a notification on their portal when you set this promotion it could send them an email or As another layer what you might need to do And this It''s a little bit of manual work, but this is honestly kind of just e-commerce. Let me just go badges You would create a product badge that would display whatever text you''re wanting it to say About the product so they know that they''re getting a 10% off within this time frame Is it customizable? Yeah, so Essentially you just type in the text that you want the badge to say and then If you want to have a different hypertext and then the text color is just a hex code. You can just select Cool, so So the application of some of the these things that would be specific to a customer''s Account or portal within the site would be for us having What am I trying to say? For example, if you have a website that you want to promote You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website You can go to the website. You can go to the website. You can go to the website So You''ll be able to log in if you wanted to check out for a customer you could like if a sales rep had to place an order or Send a customer an email And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer And then you can go to the website and you''ll be able to check out for a customer Or Send a customer a quote you can build quotes on the back end but the answer to your question is yes, you could Do all of that or see all of that information on the customer profile? Awesome. Okay, cool What about so a Customer purchases something. What are the rules of hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this this hit a dollar amount threshold or uh These are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return or what whatever Logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going? Yep got an order place it Yeah, so craig. I wish we had jamie here We have a technical guy on the e-automate side that could tell you what buttons we press Uh to to pause it better than I could but I know that we do it with every erp so it could be certain It can be certain orders or items or certain customers even like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out And you want them to have to approve everything that can all be customized um Some of it is dependent on the erp though. Like there''s some work That can be erp specific And I sure I mean technically how they set it up. But yes, we do that all well I imagine for you know, we we go live with this the first month or so We probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure We''ve got all the kinks worked out just to lay eyes on We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders You can give us a scenario that would concern you and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like that''s one layer and then like in all likelihood Um, all your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might typically people migrate them on Yeah, yeah just so it''s digestible for you guys if you can get a feel for like what does this look like and it''s a customer you trust and so yeah Well, jeff will attest i''m very good at breaking websites Hey They''re easy to break man. I it''s not a Yeah, it''s not difficult to do So i''ll tell you guys i''ve been i''ve been doing this 39 years um, and we''ve rolled out a lot of products and I am very proud of what cj and the team has done. This product is amazing and uh, the integration we built into the automate only enhances it so We''re excited about it. Um, i''ve I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this. So they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution And it''s exciting to get it In front of you guys for sure Awesome Cj, uh, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could please um, one of the challenge that we''re Challenges we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like? And you know how we can make sure that you know, we have the resources we need to make the solution successful Yep so two years During implementation. You''re going to get assigned a technical person And more of a customer success person So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole And they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you so that''s an actual person right that You can reach out to but the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use intercom We''re the only product within eci that uses this We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business And so again, like you have solutions experts live on here these aren''t People that are gonna like you have a problem. They''re not going to say. Yeah, let me get a hold of someone They can solve the problem like the actual Developers and solutions experts and so if you put something in the chat need help though, like I said, i''ve never Had a reply in over five minutes and they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles They''re really really really good. So They will jump on a call. Oh, yeah, absolutely absolutely And do you guys have sls in place for that or is that like Like you said five minutes is the longest you''ve that you''ve waited So if you go in here this and this is really just to cover our base It says we typically reply in under 20 minutes, there''s not a concrete sla to answer your question. This is just me Uh Giving you a look and feel but what I can do like i''ll just put something vague in the chat right now And as we''re talking we can just see how long it takes them Um I don''t know. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens, but no like to answer your question, uh Well, I can''t see that far did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond If I tell them i''m on a demo they will get they''ll be like super quick and so I did it on purpose, uh because I do I mean, um, like I am not I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years But I in nate i''m not a website person. Like i''ve never been a web developer So these demo stores I build them out myself and I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself and so um It''s quicker to get a hold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a teams chat like on Microsoft teams and so I use it all the time and uh Again, i''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but i''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. So How many people for your demo? They''re probably helping real customers instead of you right now Say that again They''re probably helping real customers. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they see something from me pop up. They''re probably annoyed but that''s okay You should know that now but they so we have a knowledge base. Um Um, so sometimes what they''ll do if it''s an answer that''s like Let me see I might have to go to a different I might have to go to my uh, Edge browser to pull this up if they If it''s an answer that''s like In our knowledge base that you guys have access to they might ping you an article real quick and say hey check paragraph five Or something like that. Um at at least case, but you''ll have access to this as well So it''s just another layer of like self-service If there''s something that you have a question about um You can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials, too. So cool I don''t know how many people they have oh, yeah, I was just curious how big that support team is that that manages that Yeah Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now So and there might be more I normally can only see three but we have 30 and again keep in mind, um There''s a team in the uk or sorry in the us and then a bulk of them are in the uk as well So yeah, you mentioned that earlier so close to 24 seven Not quite the close. Yep. Yeah Okay, awesome so Um Well, we are coming up on the hour, uh david I see that you''ve joined Uh, do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time, I mean it''s very informative Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So no all good Great Thank you. David robert anything else on your side? Uh, I think I think i''m good. I think we we just need somebody who knows how Gfi uses the automate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which It''s the same company. So I know they''re flexible but just to validate that I would say would probably be good Yeah, yeah, I agree. Um I know andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us. So i''ll have a follow-up with him And then i''m assuming at some point we need to get susan involved in this conversation I would assume so because they''re gonna have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from you know To here and groom or whatever to this and then into e-automate Yeah, and she''s gonna know just so you guys know to their the Before we got too involved or took this too far. We wanted to make sure we understood it And saw the fit but then um you know next steps for us is probably going to be getting um, like the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and And reconciliation and that kind of stuff because nobody on this call today touches that and I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with What the process would look like and and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless um process there uh For both on our side, but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now But this has been great. Yeah I''m your non-technical demo guy And so this is a craig that sounds like definitely jamie and then maybe someone from claire''s team You''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions Okay, that sounds great. So jamie, um, jamie''s my se on the automate side. So He''s from the uk. So if we can look at a time I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar In the morning if that''ll work for you some morning next week. Um jeff I can Talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys But um, we''ll get jamie and claire on a call with your group whoever that is the new group and Go over any questions they have Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that craig. So let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep Sounds good. Any other questions for cj? Well, we got this is kind of the layout of Integration, but we could get deeper in with claire. Also. Yeah, this is high level I was just just so everybody knows implementation timeline typically around six months is safe we can go faster we can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week you meet with our team and That would be standard Okay, sounds good Cool. All right, everybody. It''s great to meet you all. Um, jeff. You need anything don''t hesitate to reach out. But yeah, look forward to talking soon Absolutely. Thanks guys Thank you. Thanks everybody You', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about JobBoss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? JobBoss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, JobBoss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do coating for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with JobBoss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. So. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where are we gonna go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s gonna get, it''s gonna grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, a deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like, I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. So as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, it comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know, like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of material, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. Yeah. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have in the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Jobshop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location in- Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs and I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might''ve been the name that he said. So very possible. Well, let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. I''ll just type in as we were talking too so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay, well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay, thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay, you too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Meeting Summary:**

How are you, Chrissy? Good. How''s everybody doing over there? Good for Friday. Good for Friday. Yeah. Yeah, TGIF. It''s been a week. January was its own year, I''m pretty sure. Are you guys in St. Louis or Jeff City? St. Louis. Got it. Yeah. I was actually in Jeff City most of the week, but back in the office today. There you go. Yeah. Hey, Robert. Good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon. Jeff, I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know there''s several people invited, but I''ll just let you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off. Okay. I''m not sure who all is available on our end. Robert, thanks for hopping on. I think Andrew''s in another meeting, and I''m not sure about David, so it might just be us. Yeah, just know that we''re using Fathom. We''re recording it, so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join, but they can watch at their leisure. Well, thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call EvolutionX. You guys have been going down this path a little bit, trying to work with a vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already that''s fully vetted, everything that you''re looking to have in the solution, I think we have for you guys. We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you. CJ''s on the phone. CJ comes from EvolutionX. I''m your account manager from the Automate Sandpoint. I''m from Jeff City, Missouri. I''ve been doing this 39 years, so I''m happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well. But anyway, CJ''s going to kind of go over the product in a little high level. Please ask questions. This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward. So with that, I''m going to turn it over to you, CJ. Yeah, so Chrissy, Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team fairly extensively last year, and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo. Would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on EvolutionX, like who we are, how we work, any of that type of stuff? Or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake, just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just the clip notes. I''ll give you 30,000 foot. If you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So EvolutionX e-commerce is a B2B e-commerce software that''s been around about 17 years. And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago, and it was just because they had enough customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that ECI build an integration. It just made sense for them to buy us. And so now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates division and customer base. And so we''ve had several customers, I don''t know, throughout the last six months beginning to onboard, and it''s been a lot of fun. So just think of this as a robust B2B e-commerce software that would compete with any big box player out there. But we''re bringing it to the small, medium-sized distributor within the ECI family. Awesome. Cool. I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this. So this demo is for you guys. Stop me anywhere. We can pivot. I''m definitely going to be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform. But this is the flow that I''m going to go through. I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like. We''ll give you a back-end overview, and I''ll make a change on the homepage of my website so you can see what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage. Some search functionality, once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded, you''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results. Some marketing tools, and then I will log in as a customer at the end so you can get a feel for what that''s going to look like for your customers. Okay. So I pulled a few customer examples here. He''s not. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, I misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here. We designed these in-house for you guys. So the way this would work, if you decide to go with EvolutionX, our design team consults with you, and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do no custom design, we can go a few different routes, and I''ve pulled examples of each. So this is a fully custom homepage for a dealer that''s in the office supply space. They also sell some technology and other products as well. But I think from a design perspective, we can make this look any way you want it to look. Some people have a vision for what this dropdown might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side. A lot of different ways we can look to go about this, but I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology, any category of products, they should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for. So in this instance, we''ll just go to printers. If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees, we can have as many or as few of these as you want. But again, ideally, these customers are going to be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website. What if they have a SKU and know exactly the product that they''re looking for? Yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable. 100%. So that''s where some of the search capability will come into play, where if you want them to be able to search by the product number, reference number, that can be done any way you guys want. Cool. We''ll have full flexibility over the search bar. Okay, so it can even index the description for, I put in Dell 14-inch 256 gig, it''s going to go, hey, here''s five results that have those words in the description. Yep, it would pull up from the description, the category, the attributes, whatever fields we need to pull it from, absolutely. And this, I think, is important to note. I say that we''re a white glove service, but your arm-in-arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really good customer success team helping you build this website. A lot of this is, we''re going to train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck. Like, if you want to go do these things on your own in the future, we don''t want to stand in your way. But if you do want help with these things, you''ll have live chat support from us, you''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to pull up in search the way you want. But ideally, we''re going to help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live. That way, the search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website. Awesome. Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up. They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little submenus would pop up. So just giving you a feel for possibilities. I think we can design anything you guys would want, but this will be something to think about, Jeff and all of you, as we go down this road. If you do want customization, we''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team. That way, they can make recommendations and hear what you''re looking for, and we can probably scope you on the design aspect of it. Now, looking at less custom design, this website is one of our out-of-the-box themes. So at a base level, we have some templates or themes, we call them, that we can spin up, and essentially, we would put your color scheme, your branding, your logo. We would put media in here from you guys, or we can supply it. But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like. If you want to have a shop by brand, a banner running across the site. So anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has a unique design. CJ, just a quick question, going back to the searching functionality. One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example, it doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description. Did I hear you say that EvoX actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely. Keywords, attributes. So you can go back on any given product, and there''s a field where you can say, we call it keywords, but if you type in a keyword and associate it with that product, it means that line of products will pop up whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it. And this, I think, is important to note. I say that we''re a white glove service, but your arm-in-arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really good customer success team helping you build this website. A lot need to only have access to certain accounts, that''s very doable. But I have CJ''s Furniture Co. as a made-up account. Before I log in, just to show you, you''ll have some data at the organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history. You can track their spin and the trajectory of that, their search history, the top users, all of that stuff. But I''ll go log in as a user here. So I have myself made up as an account, and I''m going to go log in on my profile. So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do what I''m showing you right now, you could do that. You can target promotions to people specifically. Just to take a step back, I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer. So this is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The homepage of your website could look totally different as well. But when your customers log in, this is the portal experience that they''re going to have on your website. There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do, but you can put their logo. When they log in, instead of your logo, theirs is going to show up at the top of the website. Obviously, their user profile, you can put their headshot. They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history. They could quickly just click view, get into a recent order, print it, email it, or just click reorder all, and all those items will be added to the cart. So that''s one way they could do a quick reorder. They have multiple saved carts. They''ll be able to view that, multiple credit cards. Two scenarios. If they have a budget assigned to them by their boss, this is where they can come in and check the status of their budget, the balance remaining. Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders, or if they''re the person that has to approve the orders, those would all filter in the orders to approve field. But they''ll have access to some surface level stuff here, and then when they click their name, this side menu is going to come up. If you want to do rewards points, you can do stuff like that, like a traditional e-commerce type of feature, but a quick list would be what I think you call like a favorites list. So if I was a sales rep, I could go in and build these for my customers, or the customer could do it themselves, but ideally if every time I have to restock the copy room, I buy the same things, I would just put those items on a quick list. The quantities could be preset, or a customer can just check a box and say add those items to the cart. These can be set up on recurring order. If they buy the same things on the same days of every month, no challenges with any of that, and all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process. CJ, quick question. Going back to the approver relationship, is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an automated email to the approver when one of his employees submits an order? Yeah, absolutely. So this is where you will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say, for example, I''m a CFO, and you made me a super admin user. They could set this up, or again, you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want, and so under advanced settings or approval settings, and I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load. Oh, there we go. So this is where they would come in and set their, there''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want, and then this will trigger the email to your point. So if they wanted to track by cost center, so maybe they want to track spend by department. If they wanted to create budgets for specific users, they could come in and do that here, and if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month, anything above that''s going to acquire approval, they would save those settings. Then what we do on the back end, we have email templates that can be customized, and we would just associate that template with that account for that event. So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens, we would just tie an email template to that workflow. So does that answer the question? Yep, yeah it does, and in case you guys hear the alarms, we''re just doing our testing today, so it''s not like we''re, you know, code red or anything. Okay, I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that. I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it. Okay. Yeah. We can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I was going to say it''s probably inconvenient for you. I thought it was the ice cream truck. That''d be nice. So you''re doing a good job of guiding me, Jeff. These are all the things I normally would show, but I want to keep this relevant to you. So what other things have we not hit on that you guys have questions about or want to see? So we have the capability to take credit cards through, I guess, the Stripe platform, and then we also have the option on here to accept, or for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is. I''m assuming, Craig, are y''all using NetOne? I don''t know. You guys use NetOne? We''re currently using Stripe to accept credit card payments, but I think to further Chrissy''s question, we''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with eAutomate from kind of an accounting perspective. Got it. So the short answer is yes. We can, like, I''ll show you the App Store. You can certainly use Stripe. My store is actually set up with Stripe, but this is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services, HubSpot as a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here, but ideally, I know Craig can probably answer your questions about NetOne on a separate call, but if you wanted customers to obviously use NetOne or pay down using ACH, those are things that can be done as well. But Stripe, very doable. Okay. Chrissy, I''ll have some I get with you, Chrissy, on the NetOne side because the majority of our clients do use NetOne and interfaces with eAutomate, integrates, I mean, and also your customer eInfo if you''re using that. So to me, it''s a no-brain, must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in. We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate-wise and get you what those percentages would be. But yeah, let me get you in touch with them, guys. Okay. Great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data, so it''s not 100% what it would look like. This is a different ERP, but just on the customer portal end, when we do integrate this to eAutomate, there will be an invoice history tab, and this is where they would come in and view their invoice history. Typically, these fields are clickable. When it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP, so if they wanted to actually hyperlink and click into that, they could see it, but it will pull the invoice history for on and offline orders. So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still going to pull that invoice history for them to do 24-7. So that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal. Okay. I''m confused. I actually have two questions, CJ, one of which is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about. Do customers, shoppers, have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah. So we''ll show that. Chrissy, you said you''re confused? Yeah. Can you just recap this page that you''re on again? Yep. You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect. So EvolutionX integrates with 30 different ERP systems. Oh, okay. So eAutomate is one. We work with a number of different... So the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to eAutomate for that reason. So I have a demo store that has some fake data to where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in, they will have an invoice history tab. So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website. Oh, okay. The data doesn''t look... Yeah. It doesn''t look exactly the same as what the eAutomate data will look like because this is fake data. Just to give you an idea of what it would look like, they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up. But anyway, we''re going to feed all orders... Essentially, yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history. And the reason that''s relevant is maybe, again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you, but you can still access their invoice history without having to call you, right? So it''s going to pull all orders on and offline. Nice. That''s awesome. CJ, I heard you say... Now, your question, I''ll show you. Sorry. I''m just going to circle back to that one. So I''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart. So this is where, again Customer purchases something, what are the rules of, hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this, this hit a dollar amount threshold, or these are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return, or whatever logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going, yep, got an order, place it. Yeah, so Craig, I wish we had Jamie here. We have a technical guy on the eAutomate side that could tell you what buttons we press to pause it better than I could, but I know that we do it with every ERP, so it could be certain orders or items or certain customers even, like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out and you want them to have to approve everything. That can all be customized. Some of it is dependent on the ERP, though, like there''s some work that can be ERP specific. Sure, I mean, technically how they set it up, but yes, we do that all the time. I imagine for, you know, we go live with this the first month or so, we probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure we''ve got all the kinks worked out, just to lay eyes on it. We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders. You can give us a scenario that would concern you, and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like that''s one layer, and then like in all likelihood, all of your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might, typically people migrate them on in batches. Yeah, just so it''s digestible for you guys and you can get a feel for like what does this look like, and it''s a customer you trust, and so, yeah. And Jeff will attest I''m very good at breaking websites. Hey, they''re easy to break, man. It''s not a, yeah, it''s not difficult to do. I''ll tell you guys, I''ve been doing this 39 years, and we''ve rolled out a lot of products, and I am very proud of what CJ and the team has done. This product is amazing, and the integration we built into eAutomate only enhances it, so we''re excited about it. I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this, so they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution, and it''s exciting to get it in front of you guys for sure. CJ, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could, please. One of the challenges that we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution. A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like and, you know, how we can make sure that, you know, we have the resources we need to make the solution successful? Yep. So two years during implementation, you''re going to get assigned a technical person and more of a customer success person. So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole, and they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you. So that''s an actual person, right, that you can reach out to. But the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use Intercom. We''re the only product within ECI that uses this. We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business. And so, again, like you have our solutions experts live on here. These aren''t people that are going to – like you have a problem, they''re not going to say, yeah, let me get a hold of someone. They can solve the problem. Like those are the actual developers and solutions experts. And so if you put something in the chat and need help, like I said, I''ve never had a reply in over five minutes. And they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles. They''re really, really, really good. So they will jump on a call? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Do you guys have SLAs in place for that, or is that like – like you said, five minutes is the longest you''ve waited. So if you go in here, and this is really just to cover our base, it says we typically reply in under 20 minutes. There''s not a concrete SLA to answer your question. This is just me giving you a look and feel. But what I can do, like I''ll just put something vague in the chat right now, and as we''re talking, we can just see how long it takes them. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens. But, no, like to answer your question – Well, I was going to say, I can''t see that far. Did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond right away? I didn''t. Typically, I didn''t tell them. If I tell them I''m on a demo, they will be like super quick, and so I did it on purpose. Because I do – I mean, like I am not – I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years, but I''m not a website person. Like I''ve never been a web developer. So these demo stores, I build them out myself, and I have trouble all the time, or I run into stuff, and I have to use this myself. And so it''s quicker to get a hold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a Teams chat, like on Microsoft Teams. And so I use it all the time. And, again, I''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but I''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. How many people – They''re probably helping real customers instead. Say that again? They''re probably helping real customers instead. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. If they see something from me pop up, they''re probably annoyed, but that''s okay. They''re like, CJ, you should know. But so we have a knowledge base. So sometimes what they''ll do, if it''s an answer that''s like – let me see. I might have to go to a different – I might have to go to my Edge browser to pull this up. If they – if it''s an answer that''s like in our knowledge base that you guys have access to, they might ping you an article real quick and say, hey, check paragraph five or something like that at a lease case. But you''ll have access to this as well, so it''s just another layer of, like, self-service. If there''s something that you have a question about, you can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials too. Cool. CJ, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could, please. One of the challenges that we''re – challenges we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution. A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses.

Is Wayne around?

Yes, just a minute.

Hello?

Hey Wayne, it''s Kayla over with ECI. You remember me?

Oh yes, yes.

Perfect. How was Europe?

Good, good, yeah. Can''t complain. I mean, sometimes it gets like too hot, you know? Right. But yeah, no, it''s nice to get away and, you know, can''t be just chilling out on the Mediterranean and yeah, it''s hard to beat that. Yeah, I still haven''t made it over there, but the furthest I''ve been was Africa and that was a really fun trip. We did like a safari thing, but well good, glad that you''re getting back into the swing of things. So I was just calling to see how the calendar''s looking and if we could maybe carve out some time, you know, Wednesday or Thursday, maybe like 15 minutes for a phone call. Yeah, I don''t think my position has changed at all, unfortunately. Yeah, we''re just, you know, we''re sort of just cruising along with our old system. Yeah, I don''t think there''s anything in like, you know, there''s no sort of urge to change at this point in time. I mean, unless something really like goes haywire with this software. I mean, the whole point of changing it was that we were losing support for this system. Like the guy or the guys that programmed it, he passed away and then, you know, we were kind of, we were concerned about like, you know, like support and like going forward and stuff. And then plus like actually that we know there was some exciting features that we were going to enjoy with the ECI system. But at the end of the day, it just got like too much for what we were trying to, what we were going to use it for. And so far the old system has hung in there. So it''s almost like until something really, really goes haywire, I don''t know if we''re going to do anything. That makes sense. I have no problem with that. Obviously, you guys know the best thing. I really just like the initial phone call really is just like to give you like an idea of what''s new. And like, it''s more of a brainstorming networking type of thing rather than a sales call. So that''s what I was going to set you up with is just something quick. He can kind of go over like what''s been new because it''s been many years since we''ve kind of showed you from my records. It''s been many years since we''ve showed you like kind of what our system can do. We''re also significantly cheaper now. There''s just like a lot of updates. So yeah, that''s the initial call is just more of a, I don''t know, I''d say more of like a networking and informational thing. And then if you don''t find it valuable or whatever, you''re still kind of in the same boat, then we''re not going to be upset or anything like that. We''re not going to harass you. No, and it definitely wasn''t like a lack of like the system wasn''t going to be good. Like, you know, it''s just more or less like I said, until something really like critical happens, then we''re not going to like, in other words, we''re not going to like upset the apple cart here, which I, because I mean, yeah, we were pretty deep. We were pretty deep in the process. Like, you know, we had it all paid for and, you know, we were in the setup phase and like, you know, we were, I had tablets for all the guys that were going to punch in or clock in, clock out. Like, you know, we kind of had everything really going, but then it just like, you know, at the 11th hour, it was like, you know, this might just be like actually like too much like to take on at this point. And so we kind of just went back with the old system, you know, kind of just got cold feet and like, you know, just stuck with what works. Like we know where it works and we know that it''s kind of a little bit more bulletproof and like, and so, you know, until, yeah, I don''t think anybody really like, you know, unfortunately that''s just kind of, I guess how things work is, you know, unless something blows up, then it''s, you know. But yeah, I mean, I did like the, I did like some of the features and things. So, you know, I can definitely be down for like a quick, you know, just like a refresher on like what it does or what''s new. And then I could put that in and just keep that in my back pocket, right? That''s kind of what I was thinking. Because that way, you know, if something does blow up, then you''re already like, okay, well, I already got this in my mind. So I can just have Matt do like a very like quick, like low pressure phone call sometime tomorrow. Do you have some time, maybe like 10, 1030, 11, somewhere in there? I''m going to be making sales calls tomorrow, so I will be out of the office. But Thursday and Friday, Monday, basically any day but tomorrow. Okay, let''s do Thursday. It looks like I''ve got like 1 p.m., so basically the same time I''m calling now. Yep, yep, that works. Okay, all right, I will do that. It''ll just, yeah, like I said, it''ll just be a quick little phone call and that will show you everything that''s kind of new, talk through workflows and things like that. And then we''ll go from there. And if we put it on hold for a while, no worries at all. Yeah, no, for sure, for sure. All right, well, yeah, thanks for reaching out. And yeah, I will hear from you guys on Thursday. Okay, all right, I''ll send you like a little invite. That way you''ve got like a little reminder, but it''ll just be a phone call. So yeah, all right, we''ll talk soon, Wayne. Very good, thanks. Thank you, all right, bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, Justin. This is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good. How are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. It looked like you might have been doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center. And we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s. And that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird. It''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. OK. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff. And we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff. And we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction, into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. OK. Yeah. That''s OK. That''s kind of where we step in. And we help with the educational piece. And through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you. Or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. OK. That''s great. OK. So yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you. Go ahead. Where were you going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand. Is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew. But it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine. Stuff where I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything. Just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe. And that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business. Actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question. But it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer. And then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us. But I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Exactly. Yeah. And ideally, I look at, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend. A lot of their work comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends. And then they can add other processes to their order. So they have a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call the BOM, the bill of materials. And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works. But that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing. Because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. OK. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now as far as kind of getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. OK. OK. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers. But just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to mid-sized shops. So it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level? And what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. OK. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in? Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, you''re in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, it''s San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there. And she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. OK. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way, you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. OK. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here. And hopefully, she''ll be calling you here soon. OK. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. OK. You too. Bye-bye.

How are you Chrissy? Good. How''s everybody doing over there? Good for Friday. Good for Friday. Yeah. Yeah, TGIF. It''s been a week. January was its own year, I''m pretty sure. Are you guys, I''m sorry, are you guys in St. Louis or Jeff City? St. Louis. Yeah, got it. Yeah, I was actually in Jeff City most of the week, but back in the office today. There you go. Yeah. Hey Robert, good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon. Jeff, I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know there''s several people invited, but I''ll just let you, you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off. Okay. I''m not sure who all is available on our end. Robert, thanks for hopping on. I think Andrew''s in another meeting and I''m not sure about David, so it might just be us. Yeah, just know that we are, we''re using Fathom, we''re recording it so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join, but they can watch at their leisure. So, well, thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call Evolution X. It''s, you guys have been going down this path a little bit, trying to work with a vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already that''s fully vetted, everything that you''re looking to have in the solution, I think we have for you guys. So, we wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you, CJ''s on the phone, CJ comes from Evolution X, I''m your account manager from the Automate Sandpoint, I''m from Jeff City, Missouri, been doing this 39 years, so happy to work with you guys, I know Bruce really well. But anyway, CJ''s going to kind of go over the product, the end of the little high level, please ask questions. This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward. So, with that, I''m going to turn it over to you, CJ. Yeah, so Chrissy, Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team fairly extensively last year, and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo, but would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on Evolution X, like who we are, how we work, any of that type of stuff, or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake, just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure, just the clip notes, I mean, if you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So, Evolution X e-commerce is a B2B e-commerce software that''s been around about 17 years, and so we got acquired by ECI two years ago, and it was just because they had enough customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that ECI build an integration. It just made sense for them to buy us, and so now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates division and customer base, and so we''ve had several customers, I don''t know, throughout the last six months beginning to onboard, and it''s been a lot of fun. So, just think of this as a robust B2B e-commerce software that would compete with any big box player out there, but we''re bringing it to the small, medium-sized distributor within the ECI family. Awesome. Cool. Well, I''ll share my screen, and we can jump into this. So, this demo is for you guys. Stop me anywhere. We can pivot. I''m definitely going to be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform, but this is the flow that I''m going to go through. I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like. We''ll give you a back-end overview, and I''ll make a change on the homepage of my website so you can see what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage. Some search functionality, once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded, you''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results, some marketing tools, and then I will log in as a customer at the end so you can get a feel for what that''s going to look like for your customers. Okay. So, I pulled a few customer examples here. I pulled a few customer examples here. We designed these in-house for you guys. So, the way this would work, if you decide to go with Evolution X, our design team consults with you, and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do no custom design, we can go a few different routes, and I''ve pulled examples of each. So, this is a fully custom homepage for a dealer that''s in the office supply space. They also sell some technology and other products as well. But I think from a design perspective, we can make this look any way you want it to look. Some people have a vision for what this dropdown might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side. A lot of different ways we can look to go about this, but I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology, any category of products, they should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for. So, in this instance, we''ll just go to printers. If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees, we can have as many or as few of these as you want. But again, ideally, these customers are going to be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website. What if they have a SKU and know exactly the product that they''re looking for? Yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable. 100%. So, that''s where some of the search capability will come into play, where if you want them to be able to search by the product number, reference number, that can be done any way you guys want. Cool. We''ll have full flexibility over the search bar. Okay, so it can even index the description for, I put in Dell 14-inch 256 gig, it''s going to go, hey, here''s five results that have those words in the description. Yep, it would pull up from the description, the category, the attributes, whatever fields we need to pull it from, absolutely. And this, I think, is important to note. I say that we''re a white glove service, but your arm-in-arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really good customer success team helping you build this website. A lot of this is, we''re going to train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck. Like, if you want to go do these things on your own in the future, we don''t want to stand in your way. But if you do want help with these things, you''ll have live chat support from us, you''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to pull up in search the way you want. But ideally, we''re going to help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live. That way, the search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website. Awesome. Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up. They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little submenus would pop up. So just giving you a feel for possibilities. I think we can design anything you guys would want, but this will be something to think about, Jeff and all of you, as we go down this road. If you do want customization, we''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team. That way, they can make recommendations and hear what you''re looking for, and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. Now, looking at less custom design, this website is one of our out-of-the-box themes. So at a base level, we have some templates or themes, we call them, that we can spin up. And essentially, we would put your color scheme, your branding, your logo. We would put media in here from you guys, or we can supply it. But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like. If you want to have a shop by brand, a banner running across the site. So anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has a unique design. CJ, just a quick question, going back to the searching functionality. One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example, it doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description. Did I hear you say that EvoX actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely. Keywords, attributes. So you can go back on any given product, and there''s a field where you can say, we call it keywords, but if you type in a keyword and associate it with that product, it means that line of products will pop up whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it. And this, I think, is important to note. I say that we''re a white glove service, but your arm-in-arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really need to only have access to certain accounts, that''s very doable. But I have CJ''s Furniture Co. as a made-up account. Before I log in, just to show you, you''ll have some data at the organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history. You can track their spin and the trajectory of that, their search history, the top users, all of that stuff. But I''ll go log in as a user here. So I have myself made up as an account, and I''m going to go log in on my profile. So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do what I''m showing you right now, you could do that. You can target promotions to people specifically. Just to take a step back, I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer. So this is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The homepage of your website could look totally different as well. But when your customers log in, this is the portal experience that they''re going to have on your website. There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do, but you can put their logo. When they log in, instead of your logo, theirs is going to show up at the top of the website. Obviously, their user profile, you can put their headshot. They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history. They could quickly just click view, get into a recent order, print it, email it, or just click reorder all, and all those items will be added to the cart. So that''s one way they could do a quick reorder. They have multiple saved carts. They''ll be able to view that, multiple credit cards. Two scenarios. If they have a budget assigned to them by their boss, this is where they can come in and check the status of their budget, the balance remaining. Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders, or if they''re the person that has to approve the orders, those would all filter in the orders to approve field. But they''ll have access to some surface level stuff here, and then when they click their name, this side menu is going to come up. If you want to do rewards points, you can do stuff like that, like a traditional e-commerce type of feature, but a quick list would be what I think you call like a favorites list. So if I was a sales rep, I could go in and build these for my customers, or the customer could do it themselves. But ideally, if every time I have to restock the copy room, I buy the same things, I would just put those items on a quick list. The quantities could be preset, or a customer can just check a box and say add those items to the cart. These can be set up on recurring order. If they buy the same things on the same days of every month, no challenges with any of that. And all of those items I added, obviously, are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process. CJ, quick question. Going back to the approver relationship, is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an automated email to the approver when one of his employees submits an order? Yeah, absolutely. So this is where you will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say, for example, I''m a CFO, and you made me a super admin user. They could set this up, or again, you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want. And so under advanced settings or approval settings, and I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load. Oh, there we go. So this is where they would come in and set their, there''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want, and then this will trigger the email to your point. So if they wanted to track by cost center, so maybe they want to track spin by department. If they wanted to create budgets for specific users, they could come in and do that here. And if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month, anything above that''s going to acquire approval, they would save those settings. Then what we do on the back end, we have email templates that can be customized, and we would just associate that template with that account for that event. So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens, we would just tie an email template to that workflow. So does that answer the question? Yep, yeah it does. And in case you guys hear the alarms, we''re just doing our testing today, so it''s not like we''re, you know, code red or anything. Okay, I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that. I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it. Okay. Yeah. We can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I was going to say it''s probably inconvenient for you. I thought it was the ice cream truck. That''d be nice. So you''re doing a good job of guiding me, Jeff. These are all the things I normally would show, but I want to keep this relevant to you. So what other things have we not hit on that you guys have questions about or want to see? So we have the capability to take credit cards through, I guess, the Stripe platform, and then we also have the option on here to accept, or for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is. I''m assuming, Craig, are y''all using NetOne? I don''t know. You guys use NetOne? We''re currently using Stripe to accept credit card payments, but I think to further Chrissy''s question, we''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with eAutomate from kind of an accounting perspective. Got it. So the short answer is yes. We can, like, I''ll show you the App Store. You can certainly use Stripe. My store is actually set up with Stripe, but this is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services, HubSpot as a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here, but ideally, I know Craig can probably answer your questions about NetOne on a separate call, but if you wanted customers to obviously use NetOne or pay down using ACH, those are things that can be done as well. But Stripe, very doable. Okay. Chrissy, I''ll have some I get with you, Chrissy, on the NetOne side because the majority of our clients do use NetOne and interfaces with eAutomate, integrates, I mean, and also your customer eInfo if you''re using that. So to me, it''s a no-brain, must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in. We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate-wise and get you what those percentages would be. But yeah, let me get you in touch with them, guys. Okay. Great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data, so it''s not 100% what it would look like. This is a different ERP, but just on the customer portal end, when we do integrate this to eAutomate, there will be an invoice history tab, and this is where they would come in and view their invoice history. Typically, these fields are clickable. When it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP, so if they wanted to actually hyperlink and click into that, they could see it, but it will pull the invoice history for on and offline orders. So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still going to pull that invoice history for them to do 24-7. So that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal. Okay. I''m confused. I actually have two questions, CJ, one of which is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about. Do customers, shoppers, have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah. So we''ll show that. Chrissy, you said you''re confused? Yeah. Can you just recap this page that you''re on again? Yep. You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect. So EvolutionX integrates with 30 different ERP systems. Oh, okay. So eAutomate is one. We work with a number of different... So the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to eAutomate for that reason. So I have a demo store that has some fake data to where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in, they will have an invoice history tab. So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website. Oh, okay. And ideally, it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Okay, cool. And so what''s your thought on, like, what are you wanting to do with that information on the eCommerce platform? Well, I mean, we pass, you know, some of the savings along, but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time. There''s not much in the IT marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup. You''re always going to end up with these deal reges and big deal pricing type stuff. Got it. So I''m going to show you, I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting. So it''s not just the pricing, but you''re wanting them to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a Customer purchases something, what are the rules of, hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this, this hit a dollar amount threshold, or these are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return, or whatever logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going, yep, got an order, place it. Yeah, so Craig, I wish we had Jamie here. We have a technical guy on the eAutomate side that could tell you what buttons we press to pause it better than I could, but I know that we do it with every ERP, so it could be certain orders or items or certain customers even, like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out and you want them to have to approve everything. That can all be customized. Some of it is dependent on the ERP, though, like there''s some work that can be ERP specific. Sure, I mean, technically how they set it up, but yes, we do that all the time. I imagine for, you know, we go live with this the first month or so, we probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure we''ve got all the kinks worked out, just to lay eyes on it. We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders. You can give us a scenario that would concern you, and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like that''s one layer, and then like in all likelihood, all of your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might, typically people migrate them on in batches. Yeah, just so it''s digestible for you guys and you can get a feel for like what does this look like and it''s a customer you trust, and so, yeah. And Jeff will attest, I''m very good at breaking websites. Hey, they''re easy to break, man. It''s not a, yeah, it''s not difficult to do. I''ll tell you guys, I''ve been doing this 39 years, and we''ve rolled out a lot of products, and I am very proud of what CJ and the team has done. This product is amazing, and the integration we built into eAutomate only enhances it, so we''re excited about it. I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this, so they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution, and it''s exciting to get it in front of you guys for sure. CJ, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could, please. One of the challenges that we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution. A lot of times, you know, we''re not getting prompt responses. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like and, you know, how we can make sure that, you know, we have the resources we need to make the solution successful? Yep. So two years during implementation, you''re going to get assigned a technical person and more of a customer success person. So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole, and they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you. So that''s an actual person, right, that you can reach out to. But the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use Intercom. We''re the only product within ECI that uses this. We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business. And so, again, like you have our solutions experts live on here. These aren''t people that are going to, like you have a problem, they''re not going to say, yeah, let me get a hold of someone. They can solve the problem. Like those are the actual developers and solutions experts. And so if you put something in the chat, need help, like I said, I''ve never had a reply in over five minutes. And they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles. They''re really, really, really good. So they will jump on a call? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Do you guys have SLAs in place for that? Or is that like you said five minutes is the longest you''ve waited? So if you go in here, and this is really just to cover our base, it says we typically reply in under 20 minutes. There''s not a concrete SLA to answer your question. This is just me giving you a look and feel. But what I can do, like I''ll just put something vague in the chat right now. And as we''re talking, we can just see how long it takes them. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens. But no, like to answer your question. I can''t see that far. Did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond right away? I didn''t. Typically, I didn''t tell them. If I tell them I''m on a demo, they will be like super quick. And so I did it on purpose. Because I do, I mean, like I am not, I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years. But I''m not a website person. Like I''ve never been a web developer. So these demo stores, I build them out myself. And I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself. And so it''s quicker to get a hold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a Teams chat. Like on Microsoft Teams. And so I use it all the time. And again, I''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster. But I''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. How many people? Oh, yeah. I was just curious how big that support team is that manages that intercom. Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now. Got it. And there might be more. I normally can only see three. But we have 30. And again, keep in mind, there''s a team in the UK, or sorry, in the US. And then a bulk of them are in the UK as well. Yeah, you mentioned that earlier. So close to 24-7. Not quite, but close. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Well, we are coming up on the hour. David, I see that you''ve joined. Do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time. I mean, it''s very informative. Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So, no, all good. Great. Thank you, David. Robert, anything else on your side? I think I''m good. I think we just need somebody who knows how GFI uses eAutomate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which it''s the same company, so I know they''re fixable. But just to validate that, I would say would probably be good. Yeah, I agree. I know Andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us, so I''ll have a follow-up with him. And then I''m assuming at some point we need to get Susan involved in this conversation as well. I would assume so, because they''re going to have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from, you know, TD or Ingram or whatever to this and then into eAutomate. Yeah, and she''s going to know, just so you guys know, too, before we got too involved or took this too far, we wanted to make sure we understood it and saw the fit. But then, you know, next steps for us is probably going to be getting, like, the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and reconciliation and that kind of stuff, because nobody on this call today touches that. And I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with what the process would look like and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless process there for both on our side but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now. But this has been great. Yeah. I''m your non-technical demo guy, and so this is, Craig, that sounds like definitely Jamie and then maybe someone from Claire''s team you''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions. Okay. That sounds great. So Jamie is my SC on the eAutomate side. So he''s from the U.K., so if we can look at a time, I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar in the morning, if that will work for you, some morning next week. Jeff, I can talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys, but we''ll get Jamie and Claire on a call with your group, whoever that is, the new group, and go over any questions they have. Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that, Craig, so let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep. Sounds good. Any other questions for CJ? This is kind of the layout of integration, but we can get deeper in with Claire also. Yeah, this is high level. Just so everybody knows, implementation timeline typically around six months is safe. We can go faster. We can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week. You meet with our team, and that would be standard. Okay. Sounds good. Cool. All right, everybody. It was great to meet you all. Jeff, if you need anything, don''t hesitate to reach out, but, yeah, look forward to talking soon. Absolutely. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Thanks, everybody.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '1. **Brief Summary:**

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good. How are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions, so I''ll just let you go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question, but essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know when someone uploads, if I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

Can you remind me, are you guys a standalone ERP system or are you a system that is an add-on to our accounting software? So we are a standalone ERP. It''s specifically built for process manufacturers, and it houses everything from formulation and quality control to production, scheduling, and traceability. Does it do the accounting portion also, like invoicing out, receiving product in, billing out, those kind of things? Yes, ma''am. We do have that finance capability. Capability? Okay.

You want to do Wednesday at 10 a.m.? Yes. Eastern? Yep, let''s do Wednesday. Oh, Eastern, that''s 9 o''clock here. Yeah, that should still work. We''re Central. Oh, you guys are Central. Okay.

And really quick, is there anything specific that y''all are looking for in kind of exploring ERP options? I mean, we want a system that''s going to track our manufacturing and cost, as well as doing the invoicing out and in and our inventory management. We have been using GP Dynamics for quite a long time, which will be sunsetting, and we haven''t been using that to its full capability. So this is add-ons to stuff we''re not doing yet that we want to be tracking and paying attention to. I got you. Okay, perfect. Well, I appreciate that.

Hey, good morning. This is Abraham over at Eastside calling for Ian. Hi, this is Ian speaking. Hey, Ian. How''s it going, man? How was your weekend? Good. How was yours? Pretty good, man. A little too short, to be honest, though. Yeah, I hear you. But hey, I''m just checking in here with the team at Jobbox Square. I know that you were kind of looking into our shop management system last year, and things just kind of didn''t move forward. I was looking at the notes. I think it was kind of like either you didn''t have an actual project or maybe just didn''t have a budget. So it''s been a while, man, so I just thought it''d be a good idea to check in, see whether you landed on something different or how you were doing now. We''re good right now, but I don''t think that program works for us. Okay. What was the last thing? Sorry, I couldn''t hear. I said we''re too small to be able to utilize it effectively. Okay, I see. And when you say too small, do you mean like what exactly do you mean by that? So tell me, what was it you were offering again? It was a management tool? Yeah, I guess the technical fancy term is like an ERP, and it''s kind of like a quote-to-cash system made for small manufacturers. And that''s why I asked what you mean by small, because this is made specifically for small shops, job shops, fab shops, et cetera. What kind of cash are we talking about? I''m sorry, say that again? What kind of cost are we talking about for your system? So I wish I could answer with kind of more clarity, because I''m not kind of like the expert that kind of gets the pricing. But there''s three different tiers, and they kind of come down to like how many users you would need and stuff like that. And they go anywhere from like I''ve seen deals anywhere from two all the way up to five figures. So it just kind of depends on different things. Yeah, that''s fairly typical for ERP systems. But yeah, we are too small. There''s only three of us in here. So it would be way overkill for us. Okay. And do you think that, again, just to give you a little more context, like I''ll give you an example of someone that thought they were too small and might be smaller than you. We actually have a one-man shop. It''s not even a shop. It''s a guy working out of his garage that uses this system. The system''s called Jobbox Square. Again, just to give you an idea, you might be right. It might be too small. It''s kind of impossible for me to know, and that''s kind of why I asked, like what do you mean by too small? And what are you guys currently using now to kind of just keep track of everything? QuickBooks. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that''s kind of what like 50% of our customers use. And QuickBooks is kind of like one of our partners. So a lot of them continue using QuickBooks. It just kind of integrates with Jobbox Square, with the ERP, and they just kind of go from there. So I''m kind of – I guess my question is do you feel that if like budget wasn''t a concern, like this could be something that, you know, you would want to look into? I just cannot see an application for it for us. You see it as what for you? I said I do not see it as an application for us. Okay. And why not? It''s based on my experience with ERP systems. Okay. And have you used Jobbox Square specifically or other ERPs? Just other ERPs. Okay. So I know I''m asking you a lot of questions, man, and the reason why is it''s just kind of what we do. Like we – I''ve seen the impact that our system has. A lot of the customers that I''ve kind of helped brought in, we''ve had the same conversation. Like I think we''re just small, Abraham. Like I don''t think – I don''t know if this necessarily applies for what we do, et cetera, et cetera. So that''s kind of why I''m so curious because I see the impact that the system is making for our customers. I see that it''s helping them. It''s helping them grow. And honestly, a lot of them would even tell you that the reason why they felt that they were too small in the first place is because they weren''t using something that could kind of help streamline their growth. So, I mean, all that being said, man, it''s like because I can''t answer the questions about the pricing that well for you, I know that Holly, who''s like our expert in California, I know that she''ll be more than happy to have a quick conversation with you. This isn''t a, hey, let''s try to get Ian to buy the system today. It''s more of a is this something that would be helpful for him, number one? Are they really too small? Is there no need for this? And, you know, if the answer for those is like, yeah, there''s no need, this is not something that they could use, we''re not going to try to kind of move forward, let alone try to sell this to you. But we''ll try to point you in the right direction if there''s anything, like any recommendations we can make. But you never know. It might actually be something that could work for you right now as it is. I know Holly would be really happy. She loves having conversations with people just like you and kind of determining that. I mean, it''s up to you whether you''d like to take 10 minutes, 15 minutes to connect with her. If you would, I''d be more than happy to make that happen for you. There''s no harm in talking. Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, man. And also Holly, she''s been with this company for like 100 years, about 30 to be more exact. And so she knows a thing or two not just about our system, but also other systems, manufacturing, et cetera, et cetera. So let me pull up her calendar and see if I can find you guys a time that works for both of you. I think she''s pretty busy the next, like she''s pretty busy tomorrow, Thursday, Friday. She has a little bit more time for either of those days, for either Thursday or Friday. Would there be a time that you think would work for you? Yeah, around this time on Thursday. Sorry, man, say that again? I said around this time on Thursday. I''m so sorry. I couldn''t catch that. I said around 11 a.m. on Thursday. Okay, okay. 11 a.m. on Thursday. Let me see. Okay, so I think that she is free that time. Let me just put in the calendar and make sure. All right, yeah, it looks like she is open at that time. Let me just ping her just to double check. I think she has meetings scheduled around that. So let me just see if I can confirm that with her. But I think she is good for that day. And what she will be doing is she will just give you a phone call. Again, just introduce herself and kind of ask you the important questions and see if we would be a good fit as partners or not. And then based on that, she can kind of tell you, hey, I think it''s better we just kind of shake hands and part our separate ways. Or if we are a good fit, then she''ll kind of tell you what the next steps would be. And so, yeah, so she just replied to me, and she is good for Thursday, 11 a.m. Pacific time. So I''m going to send you an e-mail invite. Just do me a favor when you get it, just click accept so that it goes in your calendar and then Holly knows that you will be there. Let me make sure I got your right e-mail, Ian. Is it idober at sw-industrial.com? Yep, that''s it. All right, perfect. All right, so I''ll send that to you within the next few minutes. And, yeah, like I said, I know Holly is more than excited to chat with you, man, and I hope that we are a good fit. But even if we''re not, I really hope that she can kind of provide some value for you. All right, appreciate the call. You got it, brother. We''ll talk to you in a couple days. All right. All right, bye.

Hey, Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about JobBoss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? JobBoss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, JobBoss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do coating for sheet metal and some other things. And they actually integrated with JobBoss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. So. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where are we gonna go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s gonna get, it''s gonna grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, a deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like, I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. So as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, it comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know, like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of material, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. Yeah. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have in the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Jobshop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location in- Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works at a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs and I don''t know, she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might''ve been the name that he said. So very possible. Well, let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. I''ll just type in as we were talking too so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay, well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay, thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay, you too. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Meeting Summary:**

I have a nine-day weekend, so I am... Okay. You know what? Then I don''t want to talk to you anymore because I''m mad. My wife and I are going on vacation, celebrating our anniversary and her birthday. Well, congratulations both directions. Yeah. We are in the final hours. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Well, I hope that I don''t take up too much of your time. So I''m really walking into this blind. I don''t really know how to start this, so I''ll let you go, and then I''ll give you the information that you need. Yeah, for sure. I do this every day, all day, so I''m happy to guide you through this process, no problem. I am curious. How did you hear about us? Well, so the owner of the company has a friend that apparently uses you guys. I don''t know which friend this is. I don''t know what business that it''s really for. So he told me about it the other day, sent me a link, and I was just kind of going over it, and I''m like, look, I don''t know if it''ll work for us, but it''s worth a phone call. It''s worth asking questions, giving them information, and seeing where we land with this. So that''s where we are. Love it. Sounds good. So the way that I find it best is I can give you a 30,000-foot flyover of who we work with and what we do, and then I''ll kind of just ask some questions about your business. And at the end of this, the whole idea is just to see if it makes sense to progress to a demo, or I''ll tell you, hey, this system is not built for you guys. I don''t think it''s worth your time. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that''s perfect. Cool. So just at a very high level, we are a software product built specifically for trade contractors that work with production home builders or custom home builders to a degree. But from the ground up, we are designed to centralize the PO management process. If you''re working out of builder portals like BuildPro, SupplyPro, BuilderTrend, ITK, stuff like that, and try to bring all of that into one place to make it easy to track all the details to every project, such as scheduling, such as documents, photos, time tracking, contracts that you agree with the builder on, things of that nature. And then we provide your team with a mobile app so that everybody''s aligned in real time. They can take photos in the field, send pictures back to the office, and then you have the way of tracking billing and getting that information into an accounting system so that everything just syncs up and it''s just one unified single source of truth. Okay. Big things that we typically help with are companies who are really struggling to just stay on top of the schedules because things change so consistently in this line of work. They just need an easier way to make those changes and ensure they don''t waste trips to job sites, make sure that it''s easy to track changes in the field. If the builder needs additional work that wasn''t originally a part of the plan, just making sure that gets communicated in real time, and just making sure you''re not entering the same information across multiple systems or putting on a whiteboard that gets erased, things like that. Okay. Does that help a little bit? Yeah, and so let me tell you, I mean, and I kind of gathered that because I was, you know, obviously I was Googling and all the wonderful things, resources, just reading the testimonies from your clients. I don''t know specifically that this is really geared toward us, so let me tell you about us. We are a small lawn and landscape company. We do yard maintenance for customers. We aren''t necessarily in line with building, quote unquote. We will go do landscaping after something is built, but as far as the actual construction, we''re not in that line at all. And we work out of QuickBooks, and we''re such a small company that we literally have an admin staff of three, and we use QuickBooks. I''ve been with the company almost two years, not quite. We don''t even use a PO system here. We don''t use POs through QuickBooks, even though I would love to have a... procurement process, for the work that happens, it just doesn''t work. We hire a lot of the H-2A workers to do our lawn and landscape work for us. So we have a bit of a, I''m trying to be professional and get my words right here. So we do use a whiteboard for, you know, we have a customer that wants a landscape, that''s what goes on our board, or sod or something like that. Our guys aren''t very technical. There''s language barriers. There''s, what am I trying to say? We write in English, they like to write in Spanish. And so there''s that, you know, that as well. So given that, do you still see that this is something that would be geared toward us? Yes, mostly. There''s still a couple things I want to clarify before we continue like fully. But it''s like, this is, so just so you know, you can say and speak your language however you like. I have been in construction since birth. When I was born, my dad had a framing business that he was running. He''s a home builder now, but he has been, I''ve been in and around this industry my entire life. I own my own construction cleaning business for seven years. So however you say things is totally fine with me. I will understand. And if I don''t understand, I''ll ask. But I''ve also worked with a lot of landscaping companies. And a lot of the things that you just said are pretty much ring true for every landscaping company I''ve talked to. So the language barrier, not a problem. We built this system here in Texas. It was built by an electrician. And he had the exact same concern when he started building software for his company. It''s like, how the heck is this going to work? Our app is Spanish friendly, so it translates the information for your Spanish groups to make it easier for you guys to communicate. Okay. And so if the guys are in the field and they''re, okay, so I guess I should let you just keep going because right now I guess I don''t completely, you know, obviously I don''t understand how the whole thing works. So yeah, you go ahead. Yeah, and we''ll get to the demo and walk you through how the product works and everything. But who are some of your customers? Well, our customers are just residential for the most part. We have, we do the McDonald''s landscaping in the Southeast Texas area. We handle Smurf at West Rock, their Eva Dale facility. We do their lawn maintenance and their janitorial services. That, however, might be a different animal within itself, the janitorial, because it''s ran through the customer''s software, which is track. So there''s things that have to be done in there. I don''t really know how that would feed into this. That could actually be part of a different conversation, I guess. But as far as commercial, it''s really just the McDonald''s that we do at this point. We don''t have a lot of commercial activity. We are 98% residential. Okay. And the residential side, are you installing new landscape and sod? Are you doing irrigation? Or are you purely just, hey, like I own my home. I have somebody that comes on a biweekly basis and mows my yard and takes care. And then once a season, they do the remulch. They put flowers down, stuff like that. We do every bit of the above. Okay. So you do new installations. We do new installations. We do, we clean up existing. We do new irrigation. Or we will go repair, replace parts on older or, you know, irrigation systems that we didn''t do. So what percentage, so for those new installations, are those still, are those all directly with the homeowners? Are those with like home builders? Nope. Home owners. Okay. What percentage would you say is new install versus service work? Gosh, we have so many repeat customers until I would venture to say probably 65 to 70%, 75%. And it may be a little bit higher. It just, it varies so much from year to year. But would be our repeat customers. And then everyone else. That''s not ours. That''s y''all''s. It''s going to be new. Okay. And then how many customers do you guys currently have? Currently, we probably have 115, 120. And you said you''re managing the scheduling aspect all on a whiteboard? Yes, it''s literally the scheduling, it''s very basic because it can''t be complicated, right? I''m going to do a landscape job for you, I''m coming on this day. That''s really the part of it. So yeah, we do it on a whiteboard. It''s split into two parts, the top month, the bottom month, and we write the days on it, and these are the days we''re going to be there. Yeah, and how are you communicating that to the crews? The crews get work orders, they get punch lists, and then we talk about it with them as well, but they actually have the physical copies. Y''all have like a morning meeting where you''re like, okay, you guys are going to these jobs, here''s your paperwork? So here''s the process, and these are, let me just say, this is the process. So the owner and his son are the two that really drive the crews. And so the owner, his son, and our estimating scheduler, they meet in our nursery manager, they will meet in the mornings to go over previous day''s work, current day work, and then the owner and his son are the ones that are actually communicating with the guys and dictating to them when, where, why, how. They''re the ones making changes, so it''s really those two that are directing the traffic. Gotcha. And another question I have, are you guys, are y''all picking up your materials, your sod, things like that from a yard, or do y''all basically have it all in-house and have your own managing? No, we get that from turf farms. Okay, cool. So what do you think, did he mention why he thought it''d be a good idea to explore this system? Anything specific on that front? Yes, and I''m going to be blatantly honest. So in the office of a staff of literally three, I''m the office manager, I do billing, AP, payroll, Kevin''s personal assistant, everything. And then I have a lady that does all the estimating and scheduling, and then we''ve got Kevin and Kyler. So there''s frustrations. If we put a schedule together, but we don''t follow the process to follow that schedule, and changes are made, but that is not communicated across the board, then obviously there''s frustrations that take place, right? So that''s ultimately, in a nutshell, that''s why I''m talking to you, because that seems to happen, and he gets frustrated, and then he talks to his friends, you know, well, this is great, this works, and I''m going, well, they''re also running, you know, $80 million, we''re running six. And I''m not beating us down at all, that''s great for our industry in this area. Oh, yeah. But it''s really, we have the paper, do we need the paper, would it be easier if nobody had paper, if everybody was working off of a, you know, electronically? Well, I don''t know the answer to that, you know, I think there''s limitations with our team to a degree, but is it trainable? Probably. Yeah, and I''ll let you know now, if you guys do decide to partner up with us, and it seems like something that would work for you, we''ll take care of the training aspect. We have that built in on our side. We have an entire team dedicated to ensuring that you get set up properly. So walk me through more of these frustrations. Why are they occurring exactly? Well, a lot of our business, like I said, they''re repeat customers, and so a lot of our customers have, you know, Kevin on speed dial, or they have his phone number, or certain things come up, and so they''ll call Kevin, and they''ll want this done, and he''s moving things around, and he''s busy, and maybe he forgets to tell us, or the information doesn''t come across correctly, and, you know, myself and the estimator and scheduler, Miss Laura, we''re only as good as the information we''re given. So let me give you a little bit of how the process, once they''re on the board, well, just bear with me one second. So a customer calls, and we put the meeting on Kevin''s calendar. He''s the one that actually goes out and meets with the customer. He takes a piece of graph paper with him, and he writes notes in his own way, and he''ll do a very rough sketch of what the conversation is about, how they''re wanting things to look, and, you know, the list of things that they''re wanting, whether it''s stone or mulch or whatever, whatever, whatever, and he brings that back to the office. Now, from that piece of graph paper with his scratch on it, and his rough sketch, we, my estimator and scheduler, Ms. Laura, has to decipher what he''s saying. So we take that, break it down, and build the estimate into QuickBooks off of this piece of graph paper. Now, we created a nice form. You know, we had an operations manager that came on board, created a nice form, asked him to use it. It was rejected right up front. Was not using it, and he still never did. So that is how the process starts. So that in itself is a lot of frustration. When he is seeing four to five people a day, and he''s 30 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and it''s very rough. It takes a lot of time to figure out what he''s trying to tell us sometimes. And a lot of times it''s not complete. You know, we''re constantly having to ask him questions. Well, what is this? And if you want this, then where''s it at on the drawing? And you know what I mean? It''s just a lot of back and forth. That in itself is probably the biggest thorn with the upfront process, getting it from the paper into the system. And then, you know, once it goes to the customer, once it''s an estimate, it goes to the customer, then it''s volleying back and forth with them. Well, I don''t like this. I want to change this. I want to add this, yada, yada, whatever. And then among that, we have to make sure that all these changes that the customer is making is getting into their file, into the QuickBooks, and to the guys. You know, because we don''t want to leave anything out, obviously. So herein lies the frustration. You know, something''s getting missed because somebody''s not telling us something, or, you know, we''re not deciphering correctly, or this was forgotten on the list, or, you know, you didn''t understand them correctly. They asked for this, but they didn''t know what they were asking for, that whole thing. Who''s managing those changes? Is that also Kevin, or is that whoever''s building the estimate? At what point? Well, you said that, so Kevin goes out there, does the chicken scratch doctor''s handwriting to pull it together with the customers trying to, like, communicate. He then brings that back to you guys in the office. Somebody creates an estimate out of that information in QuickBooks, and then the estimate goes back to the customer, right? Correct. And then the customer is going to make changes because they don''t know what they''re asking for. They have no clue what the heck landscaping even means. So then things are just getting moved around. Is that, who''s the changes in that process being communicated to? Is that going to Kevin back to you guys again, or is that going directly to the estimator? That''s going, it''s ultimately, I mean, oh my gosh, initially it''s going to the estimator, Ms. Laura, my clerk that puts them together. However, we typically have to run them by Kevin just to make sure that it will work. You know, they may have a small spot and they want, you know, an oak tree, but they don''t realize that that oak tree gets 50 foot tall. You know what I mean? So it goes to Laura first. If it''s something, you know, because we do it so much, a lot of times she can say, oh, well, that will work. Ultimately, it''s your house. You can do what you want, but, you know, let me run it by Kevin to make sure that it''s going to work there or see if there''s an alternative to that for you. So between Laura and Kevin, it really bounces back and forth until the customer says, okay, I approve that. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I really appreciate you just painting the picture for me and telling me how this process gets communicated because every time I talk to a landscaper, this is one of the more chaotic processes within their business is how this all unfolds. Yeah, it''s crazy. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the estimate gets done and you and the customer agree that this is the plan. What are the next steps from there? Okay. So once we agree that they pay their deposit and we schedule them on our board, our calendar, and they are notified, hey, we''re coming out in two weeks. You know, we''re going to be there in the morning or the afternoon. And so we get to that point the day before we print or the week of, we print all the work orders for the guys. We put them in their boxes so that they can familiarize themselves with, you know, what''s going on. In between that, you know, someone''s pulling the plants. You know, there''s things once the estimate is approved, we make sure we have those plants on site in the nursery or that they''ve been ordered so that, you know, everything''s ready for the job. And then the week of, the work orders are printed and they''re given to the guys. Okay. And then we walk through the rest of that process. And then after the job''s completed, then you bill the rest of the remaining amount? That is correct. Once the job is completed, the guys have a foreman''s report that they fill out that because just because we bid 15 yards of mulch doesn''t mean we''re going to use that much. So the foreman''s report is the actual finalized number for the product or material being used. And once they bring that foreman''s report in after the job is completed, then Laura, if need be, will modify those quantities and then she will send the final invoice. And that''s all done through QuickBooks? Correct. Cool. Okay. And then are there ever changes that come up whenever your guys go out to the, are on the job? Every single day. Every day. Every day. How are those being communicated and tracked? So most of the time they''re on site, customer walks out, hey, can you add or can you do, they''ll call into the office to Laura and say, hey, she''s wanting to add or she''s wanting to do. And so, you know, Laura''s making note of that. In the meantime, we''ve got somebody coming back to the yard to pick up whatever it is that they''re wanting to add and take it to the site so that it can be done at that time. Do they ever not call Laura and they just do it? Yes. Yes. If it''s, you know, if they''ve taken, well, not even if they''ve taken extra, there are times when the customer will ask for something and, you know, Kyler, you know, will come back, grab it and take it. And then after the fact, you know, it''s on the foreman''s report and she''s like, well, what is this? It wasn''t on the estimate. Well, they wanted it, you know, when we got there or she said this before we left. Yeah, that happens a lot. Does it ever not make it on the foreman''s report? Yes. Yeah. Yes. All right. Yes. And I think it''s probably just in, you know, everybody''s trying to do what, you know, what we''ve got laid out and it''s just in the middle of it and they just, you know, forget to write it down or, you know, it''s just not accounted for or whatever, but it''s not often, but it does happen. Anything else going on just in the general process? No, I mean, that''s because once it gets to the point of the final invoice being sent to the customer, then it''s, you know, then it''s just accounts receivable collecting on that invoice. And then the process just starts over, you know. Now, once the one thing that we do that I request just from a financial perspective and the way QuickBooks handles things is if we create an estimate and the customer approves that estimate and we collect the deposit on that estimate, then if they call a couple of days later and say, oh, well, I want to add such and such or I want you to give me a quote on such and such, then I have Laura go in and create a whole new estimate because we''ve already applied a payment to that specific transaction because the way QuickBooks works is once it''s been approved and accepted, then it has to be converted to an actual invoice. So once it becomes an actual invoice, then it starts hitting my financials. And so if I apply a payment to it, but then you go in and you start adding to it, then things are wonky. So we do have, you know, those instances where we''ve already started this estimate. Oh, well, now I want to add this, but we just do it as a completely new estimate just to keep the books clean. Other than those pieces, it''s really, really that. That is the hiccup in the whole process. To me, it''s not even the whiteboard. You know, it''s not that. It''s communication for number one. And then, you know, well, I guess communication is really it across the board because if anything is changed and it''s not communicated to Laura, then she doesn''t know to revise it. If the guys do something in the field and doesn''t tell Laura or Kyler or myself, then again, here we are, you know, chase and tell. Well, what I can tell you is that landscapers pretty much across the board all have a service component to their business. Whether they work with production builders or not, service is always going to be a big part of landscaping more so than pretty much any other trade I work with just because it''s really, really easy to like basically put, install landscapes and then build a relationship with the customer and retain that business as a regular business, right? Right, right. And we, the landscapers I''ve worked with have been very successful using our system for the things that you''re describing, especially when it comes to communication breakdowns because whenever you change something in the system, it changes on a global scale. So if Kevin needs to reschedule a job in the field from the mobile app, that''s going to automatically update on your schedules in the office. But we can also, again, pictures and documentation. We can put these forms that you guys are using to build your estimates. We can template that out in our system so that Kevin can just draw on a PDF in our app, make the notes, check off boxes, send that to you guys. We even have talk-to-text, which I think is what we would push him to use. He would not, I can tell you. He won''t do it. He won''t click a button and just talk to the phone rather than type it. No, I''m sure he will not. Hey, you know what? There''s a first time for everything, and he may prove me 100% wrong. Well, I find it interesting that he would push you to take a look at a software system, but he''s not willing to use the software. Yeah, no, I completely agree. Yeah, I mean, we brought an operations manager on board to identify efficiencies or inefficiencies, and he ain''t here no more. And I''m just being, I mean, I am very black and white. There''s no gray area, you know, so I''m not about to waste your time or anything. No, you''re good. So I want you to know what it is. I would love to know who he talked to who pushed him toward this because that would help me a lot in just being like, I mean, I can tell you whoever you talk to is using the system this way, and they''re successful because of it. And I will definitely try to find out. But you know what? Let''s say for the sake of argument that he says, okay, I''ll do that. I''ll use talk to text. I use talk to text every single day of my life, and it''s great. It saves me a lot of keystrokes. Saves me a lot of time. We have this really cool ability. So in the mobile app, you can have documents, right, and you can edit these documents. And there''s a specific thing you can do where you can actually on that document, you can record a voice note, right? So if he''s drawing and doing his little things with his pencil on his iPad, he could record a voice note rather than like jotting all of this down like freehand. And then you guys in the office would just have to listen to his voice rather than try to read what he''s trying to put down. Yeah, almost like dictation. Absolutely. That would be great. Yeah. And I feel like he''s got to be able to do that for you guys more so than for himself. So let me ask you this. Okay, so say we do this, and I know that you said that the translation, and this is a big thing on my mind because all of our guys, we have a couple that can speak decent English, but they don''t always understand English so well. So if they''re in the field and they do a note and they do it, you know, speaking the note, and that comes across, we''re able to hear that in English? That translation works like that? No, I''m really hoping that we get to a point where like this new AI kick will allow us to start incorporating stuff like that because it''s pretty close. There''s some cool stuff happening with artificial intelligence. But right now we haven''t incorporated that or it''s not there yet from a technological standpoint. When it comes to like translation is one, there''s a couple different ways to look at this. One, we can have it to where all the hard-coded fields in our app translate to Spanish so that it''s easy for them to navigate. And then on the flip side, we''re also putting a lot of like we''re templating out a lot of things so that your guys don''t have to put in as many notes. They just have to click buttons, right? So when we build out forms or whatnot, it''s less of them having to jot notes down and more of them just saying, yes, I did this. No, this wasn''t there. So like a drop-down box. Exactly. And that''s something we put into Spanish so that it''s... Okay, so it''s put in Spanish. Okay, okay. I was going to say, okay, so if they check this box, I used four blue plumbagos and 16 foxtail ferns, and they put that in English because their numbers, it''s crazy. It''s not always in English. So as long as when we get it in the office, we''re able to see it in English and it''s correct, then that would be great. Yeah, because we have about 65 companies in Texas alone and then companies through New Mexico, Arizona, California, and we have no issue with the Spanish-English communication. Okay, that''s awesome. Awesome. Okay, that''s good. Any other questions? So this... product communicates with QuickBooks. So how would that work? So would we still maintain QuickBooks for billing and all of that? Or is this a replacement of QuickBooks? No, it''s not a replacement. We are not an accounting system. We do everything from the start of a project to up into billing, right? So we can create invoice drafts out of Bolt. You can manage your contracts and your items, like how much we''re going to charge for this. You could basically, for your situation, build an estimate in our system. And then when it comes time to bill on that final estimate, you could push the information from Bolt to QuickBooks so you''re not doing duplicate data entry. Okay, so let me back up for just a second so I understand. So the estimate process, Kevin has his tablet or whatever. Is it a tablet or is it just his phone? It could be a tablet or a phone. I would probably recommend a tablet for the fact that he''s drawing. Just give him more real estate to work with. But if he has a phone, we can make that work. Okay, so he has his device. He goes to the customer. So we put the customer database into, or is he actually signing on to Bolt, which is tied to QuickBooks and our customer information is feeding across from there? Or how does the customer information get? Let me back up. My brain is getting ahead of my mouth. No, you''re good. I know where you''re going, and I can explain it to you, but it''s going to be a lot easier to look at it from a visual perspective. Okay. And I think I''m confident that we can help you guys out at this, based on everything you''ve told me, your process, the challenges within your process. I think it would be best to schedule out a demo. Okay. My teammate Chrissy is our product expert. She demos Bolt. My job is just to make sure all your questions get answered and kind of just manage this process that we''re in. But the next step from here would be to schedule out that demo so you can take a look at it. I would probably say just keep it to you for now. If you like what you see, you think it''s something that could work for the team, let''s schedule out a second demo with the rest of the team once you''re confident. Okay, yeah. What do you think? Yeah, that sounds great. I think there''d be mass confusion if we did it any other way. Cool. And then you can also, like, if you like it, you can also guide us and be like, okay, let''s maybe not get too deep on this process. Let''s focus more on this thing when we talk with Kevin, stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Cool. So I am out of town next week for that vacation. Would you be okay scheduling something for, like, the first week of June? Yeah, that''s perfectly fine. Next week is actually month end for me, so not just month end, quarter end, month end. So I''ll be kind of busy next week anyway. Okay. What day would work best for you that week? Let me see. Hang on one second. Okay. I''ll tell you what, because that first week of June is a payroll week for me, can we do it the week of the 9th? Like that Tuesday the 10th would be okay. Okay. I''m going to make a note to give you a shout that Monday just to make sure nothing has come up crazy. But let''s go ahead and put something tentative on for that Tuesday. What time specifically would work best for you? If we could do around two, the afternoons seem to be a little bit better for me than the mornings. Chrissy, you have a dentist appointment at 2.30. Can we do one o''clock? Yeah, one will be fine. One will be great. All right. I will get that demo sent out, and then I''ll get Chrissy notes from this conversation so that she''s fully prepped up to address a lot of what we talked about, and we''ll just kind of go from there. Okay, awesome, Tim. Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing what you guys got. Yeah, I appreciate all the information. I love how you walked me through your company and just all the details of it. It''s awesome. Yeah, and that''s just high level. Wait till you really see it. You guys are an incredibly complex organization, but I work with landscapers all the time. Okay, well, that''s great to know. I''ll be honest. You are my second favorite trade to work with. Oh, wow. Okay, awesome. Plumbing is my favorite. Really? Yeah. Wow. It''s the most complex trade type out there, and just every single business is so incredibly different for the exact same kind of trade, but I''ve worked with more plumbing companies than I''ve worked with any trade at this point. Landscapers are definitely up there as well, though. Oh, gosh. Wow. Okay, well, I look forward to it, and I really thank you for your time and your knowledge and expertise and listening. For sure. Yeah, no, I mean, that''s the only way this thing works, right? Right, right. There''s a lot of BS software out there, and we''re just trying to make sure that we don''t rope anybody around. Right. Well, let me ask you just a ballpark high-level question. Go in the direction that we were talking about, just getting us to where the mass confusion is less confusion. Ballpark average, what does this run roughly? How many total employees do you have? That would be using the program or company-wide? We''ll probably have a better idea of who''s going to use the program once we get to the demo. You''ll have a much better idea of who needs to have access to it, but how many people in office do you guys have? Altogether, we probably have about 40. 40 total employees? Yeah. And then do you subcontract any work? It''s kind of seasonal, so in the wintertime we may have less, because again, all of our lawn and landscape, I don''t want to say all, but 22 of them are H-2A visa workers, so they all go home in November. So, yeah, but during peak season, February to October, November, we''re running about 40. Okay. I''d say we''d probably be in the ballpark of $1,000 to $1,500 a month with that user count. It could be more, it could be less. Again, you''ll have a much better idea of how many people need to have access to the system once you get an idea of how everything functions, but my recommendation is you definitely want everybody in the office to have access to the system. Any field supervisors, Kevin for sure, and then typically your crew leads will have access so that you have somebody that''s able to clock crews in, take pictures, stuff like that. Okay. Yeah, that''s still going to be a pretty good number, but yeah, we can definitely look at that. I mean, obviously later, but that''s a good ballpark to have, because he''ll ask, you know, so I can at least say roughly, you know, given certain dynamics or whatever, this is apt to change. And just so you know, all of our pricing is based on users. There''s a flat fee for the software system, and then there''s a user fee, and then we do have an implementation and training fee, and there''s three different packages you guys can choose from on that front.

Hey, Justin. This is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. It looked like you might have been- Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. And I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do coating for sheet metal and some other things. And I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is, I need a solution that''s gonna help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of where it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. So. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment. It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people. And then it became more of a focus. And so I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like, I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you, or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point to in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. So yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you, go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all''s involved with the shop would help me understand, like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to get, it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, a deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like, I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe and that''s kind of like its own little department. And then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point, but right now we''re just like eight, nine guys. And, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting that kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkut or SendCutSend, a lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal, they can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to, except the work I''m really gonna try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really wanna focus at first. So that''s where I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? Like when someone upload, if I upload an assembly, is it, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Jobbox Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would compliment the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Jobbox Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to mid-sized shops. So it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about, because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do y''all just have the one location? It''s in- Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about gonna be 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. She definitely knows all the ins and outs. I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might''ve been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay, well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay, thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay, you too.

Hey Sabrina, it''s Tim over at Bolt Software.

Hey Tim.

How are you doing?

I''m doing okay. All right, all right, gonna make it. It''s the weekend and it''s a long one, so I''ll take it.

I have a nine day weekend, so I am.

Okay, you know what? Then I don''t want to talk to you anymore because I''m mad.

My wife and I are going on vacation, celebrating our anniversary and her birthday.

Well, congratulations, both directions.

Yeah, we are in the final hours.

Awesome, awesome, awesome. Well, I hope that I don''t take up too much of your time. So I''m really walking into this blind. I don''t really know how to start this, so I''ll let you go and then I''ll give you the information that you need.

Yeah, for sure. I do this every day, all day, so I''m happy to guide you through this process, no problem. I am curious, how did you hear about us?

Well, so the owner of the company has a friend that apparently uses you guys. I don''t know which friend this is. I don''t know what business that it''s really for. So he told me about it the other day, sent me a link, and I was just kind of going over it, and I''m like, look, I don''t know if it''ll work for us, but it''s worth a phone call. It''s worth asking questions, giving them information, and seeing where we land with this. So that''s where we are.

Love it. Sounds good. So the way that I find it best is I can give you a 30,000 foot flyover of who we work with and what we do, and then I''ll kind of just ask some questions about your business. And at the end of this, the whole idea is just to see if it makes sense to progress to a demo, or I''ll tell you, hey, this system is not built for you guys. I don''t think it''s worth your time.

Okay, yeah. Yeah, that''s perfect.

Cool. So just at a very high level, we are a software product built specifically for trade contractors that work with production home builders or custom home builders to a degree. But from the ground up, we are designed to centralize the PO management process. If you''re working out of builder portals like BuildPro, SupplyPro, BuilderTrend, ITK, stuff like that, and try to bring all of that into one place to make it easy to track all the details to every project, such as scheduling, such as documents, photos, time tracking, contracts that you agree with the builder on, things of that nature. And then we provide your team with a mobile app so that everybody''s aligned in real time. They can take photos in the field, send pictures back to the office, and then you have the way of tracking billing and getting that information into an accounting system so that everything just syncs up and it''s just one unified single source of truth. Okay. Big things that we typically help with are companies who are really struggling to just stay on top of the schedules because things change so consistently in this line of work. They just need an easier way to make those changes and ensure they don''t waste trips to job sites, make sure that it''s easy to track changes in the field. If the builder needs additional work that wasn''t originally a part of the plan, just making sure that gets communicated in real time, and just making sure you''re not entering the same information across multiple systems or putting on a whiteboard that gets erased, things like that. Okay. Does that help a little bit? Yeah, and so let me tell you, I mean, and I kind of gathered that because I was, you know, obviously I was Googling and all the wonderful things, resources, just reading the testimonies from your clients. I don''t know specifically that this is really geared toward us, so let me tell you about us. We are a small lawn and landscape company. We do yard maintenance for customers. We aren''t necessarily in line with building, quote unquote. We will go do landscaping after something is built, but as far as the actual construction, we''re not in that line at all. And we work out of QuickBooks, and we''re such a small company that we literally have an admin staff of three, and we use QuickBooks. I''ve been with the company almost two years, not quite. We don''t even use a PO system here. We don''t use POs through QuickBooks, even though I would love to have a procurement process, for the work that happens, it just doesn''t work. We hire a lot of the H-2A workers to do our lawn and landscape work for us. So we have a bit of a... I''m trying to be professional and get my words right here. So we do use a whiteboard for, you know, we have a customer that wants a landscape, that''s what goes on our board, or sod or something like that. Our guys aren''t very technical. There''s language barriers. There''s... What am I trying to say? We write in English. They like to write in Spanish. And so there''s that, you know, that as well. So given that, do you still see that this is something that would be geared toward us? Yes, mostly. There''s still a couple things I want to clarify before we continue fully. So just so you know, you can say and speak your language however you like. I have been in construction since birth. When I was born, my dad had a framing business that he was running. He''s a home builder now, but I''ve been in and around this industry my entire life. I own my own construction cleaning business for seven years. So however you say things is totally fine with me. I will understand, and if I don''t understand, I''ll ask. But I''ve also worked with a lot of landscaping companies. And a lot of the things that you just said are pretty much ring true for every landscaping company I''ve talked to. So the language barrier, not a problem. We built this system here in Texas. It was built by an electrician, and he had the exact same concern when he started building software for his company. It''s like, how the heck is this going to work? Our app is Spanish-friendly, so it translates the information for your Spanish groups to make it easier for you guys to communicate. Okay, and so if the guys are in the field and they''re... Okay, so I guess I should let you just keep going because right now I guess I don''t completely... You know, obviously I don''t understand how the whole thing works. So yeah, you go ahead. Yeah, and we''ll get to the demo and walk you through how the product works and everything. But who are some of your customers? Well, our customers are just residential for the most part. We do the McDonald''s landscaping in the Southeast Texas area. We handle Smurfett Westrock, their Evadale facility. We do their lawn maintenance and their janitorial services. That, however, might be a different animal within itself, the janitorial, because it''s ran through the customer''s software, which is track. So there''s things that have to be done in there. I don''t really know how that would feed into this. That could actually be part of a different conversation, I guess. But as far as commercial, it''s really just the McDonald''s that we do at this point. We don''t have a lot of commercial activity. We are 98% residential. Okay, and the residential side, are you installing new landscape and sod? Are you doing irrigation? Or are you purely just, hey, like I own my home. I have somebody that comes on a biweekly basis and mows my yard and takes care. And then once a season, they do the remulch. They put flowers down, stuff like that. We do every bit of the above. Okay, so you do new installations. We do new installations. We clean up existing. We do new irrigation. Or we will go repair, replace parts on older irrigation systems that we didn''t do. What percentage, so for those new installations, are those all directly with the homeowners? Are those with like home builders? Nope, homeowners. Okay, what percentage would you say is new install versus service work? Gosh, we have so many repeat customers until I would venture to say probably 65 to 70%, 75%. And it may be a little bit higher. It varies so much from year to year. But would be our repeat customers and then everyone else. That''s not ours. That''s y''all''s. It''s going to be new. Okay, and then how many customers do you guys currently have? Currently, we probably have 115, 120. And you said you''re managing the scheduling aspect all on a whiteboard? Yes, it''s literally, the scheduling, it''s very basic because it can''t be complicated, right? I''m going to do a landscape job for you, I''m coming on this day. That''s really the part of it. So yeah, we do it on a whiteboard. It''s split into two parts, the top month, the bottom month, and we write the days on it, and these are the days we''re going to be there. Yeah, and how are you communicating that to the crews? The crews get work orders, they get punch lists, and then we talk about it with them as well, but they actually have the physical copies. Y''all have like a morning meeting where you''re like, okay, you guys are going to these jobs, here''s your paperwork? So here''s the process, and these are, let me just say, this is the process. So the owner and his son are the two that really drive the crews. And so the owner, his son, and our estimating scheduler, they meet in the morning, and our nursery manager, they will meet in the mornings to go over previous day''s work, current day work, and then the owner and his son are the ones that are actually communicating with the guys and dictating to them when, where, why, how. They''re the ones making changes, so it''s really those two that are directing the traffic. Gotcha. And another question I have, are you guys, are y''all picking up your materials, your sod, things like that from a yard, or do y''all basically have it all in-house and have your own managing? No, we get that from turf farms. Okay, cool. So what do you think, did he mention why he thought it''d be a good idea to explore this system? Anything specific on that front? Yes, and I''m going to be blatantly honest. So in the office of a staff of literally three, I''m the office manager, I do billing, AP, payroll, Kevin''s personal assistant, everything. And then I have a lady that does all the estimating and scheduling, and then we''ve got Kevin and Kyler. So there''s frustrations. If we put a schedule together, but we don''t follow the process to follow that schedule, and changes are made, but that is not communicated across the board, then obviously there''s frustrations that take place, right? So that''s ultimately, in a nutshell, that''s why I''m talking to you, because that seems to happen, and he gets frustrated, and then he talks to his friends, you know, well, this is great, this works, and I''m going, well, they''re also running, you know, $80 million, we''re running six. And I''m not beating us down at all, that''s great for our industry in this area. Oh, yeah. But it''s really, we have the paper, do we need the paper, would it be easier if nobody had paper, if everybody was working off of a, you know, electronically? Well, I don''t know the answer to that. You know, I think there''s limitations with our team to a degree, but is it trainable? Probably. Yeah, and I''ll let you know now, if you guys do decide to partner up with us, and it seems like something that would work for you, we''ll take care of the training aspect. We have that built in on our side. We have an entire team dedicated to ensuring that you get set up properly. So walk me through more of these frustrations. Why are they occurring exactly? Well, a lot of our business, like I said, they''re repeat customers, and so a lot of our customers have, you know, Kevin on speed dial, or they have his phone number, or certain things come up, and so they''ll call Kevin, and they''ll want this done, and he''s moving things around, and he''s busy, and maybe he forgets to tell us, or the information doesn''t come across correctly, and, you know, myself and the estimator and scheduler, Ms. Laura, we''re only as good as the information we''re given. So let me give you a little bit of how the process, once they''re on the board, well, just bear with me one second. So a customer calls, and we put the meeting on Kevin''s calendar. He''s the one that actually goes out and meets with the customer. He takes a piece of graph paper with him, and he writes notes in his own way, and he''ll do a very rough sketch of what the conversation is about, how they''re wanting things to look, and, you know, the list of things that they''re wanting, whether it''s stone or mulch or whatever, whatever, whatever, and he brings that back to the office. Now, from that piece of graph paper with his scratch on and his rough sketch, we, my estimator and scheduler, Ms. Laura, has to decipher what he''s saying. So we take that, break it down, and build the estimate into QuickBooks off of this piece of graph paper. Now, we created a nice form. You know, we had an operations manager that came on board, created a nice form, asked him to use it. It was rejected right up front. Was not using it, and he still never did. So that is how the process starts. So that in itself is a lot of frustration. When he is seeing four to five people a day, and he''s 30 minutes here, 30 minutes there, and it''s very rough. It takes a lot of time to figure out what he''s trying to tell us sometimes. And a lot of times it''s not complete. You know, we''re constantly having to ask him questions. Well, what is this? And if you want this, then where''s it at on the drawing? And you know what I mean? It''s just a lot of back and forth. That in itself is probably the biggest thorn with the upfront process, getting it from the paper into the system. And then, you know, once it goes to the customer, once it''s an estimate, it goes to the customer, then it''s volleying back and forth with them. Well, I don''t like this. I want to change this. I want to add this, yada, yada, whatever. And then among that, we have to make sure that all these changes that the customer is making is getting into their file, into the system. Into QuickBooks and to the guys, you know, because we don''t want to leave anything out, obviously. So here in lies the frustration. You know, something''s getting missed because somebody''s not telling us something or, you know, we''re not deciphering correctly or this was forgotten on the list or, you know, you didn''t understand them correctly. They asked for this, but they didn''t know what they were asking for, that whole thing. Who''s managing those changes? Is that also Kevin or is that whoever''s building the estimate? At what point? Well, you said that, so Kevin goes out there, does the chicken scratch doctor''s handwriting to pull it together with the customers trying to like communicate. He then brings that back to you guys in the office. Somebody creates an estimate out of that information in QuickBooks and then the estimate goes back to the customer, right? Correct. And then the customer is going to make changes because they don''t know what they''re asking for. They have no clue what the heck landscaping even means. So then things are just getting moved around. Is that, who''s that, the changes in that process being communicated to? Is that going to Kevin back to you guys again or is that going directly to the estimator? That''s going, it''s ultimately, I mean, oh my gosh, initially it''s going to the estimator, Ms. Laura, my clerk that puts them together. However, we typically have to run them by Kevin just to make sure that it will work. You know, they may have a small spot and they want, you know, an oak tree, but they don''t realize that that oak tree gets 50 foot tall. You know what I mean? So it goes to Laura first. If it''s something, you know, because we do it so much, a lot of times she can say, oh, well, that will work. Ultimately, it''s your house. You can do what you want. But, you know, let me run it by Kevin to make sure that it''s going to work there or see if there''s an alternative to that for you. So between Laura and Kevin, it really bounces back and forth until the customer says, okay, I approve that. Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I really appreciate you just painting the picture for me and telling me how this process gets communicated because every time I talk to a landscaper, this is one of the more chaotic processes within their business is how this all unfolds. Yeah, it''s crazy. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so the estimate gets done and you and the customer agree that this is the plan. What are the next steps from there? Okay, so once we agree that they pay their deposit and we schedule them on our board, our calendar, and they are notified, hey, we''re coming out in two weeks. You know, we''re going to be there in the morning or the afternoon. And so we get to that point the day before we print or the week of, we print all the work orders for the guys. We put them in their boxes so that they can familiarize themselves with, you know, what''s going on. In between that, you know, someone''s pulling the plans. You know, there''s things once the estimate is approved, we make sure we have those plans on site in the nursery or that they''ve been ordered so that, you know, everything''s ready for the job. And then the week of, the work orders are printed and they''re given to the guys. Okay, and then we walk through the rest of that process. And then after the job''s completed, then you build the rest of the remaining amount. That''s correct. Once the job is completed, the guys have a foreman''s report that they fill out that because just because we bid 15 yards of mulch doesn''t mean we''re going to use that much. So the foreman''s report is the actual finalized number for the product or material being used. And once they bring that foreman''s report in after the job is completed, then Laura, if need be, will modify those quantities and then she will send the final invoice. And that''s all done through QuickBooks? Correct. Cool. Okay. And then are there ever changes that come up whenever your guys go out to the, are on the job? Every single day. Every day. Every day. How are those being communicated and tracked? So most of the time they''re on site, customer walks out, hey, can you add or can you do, they''ll call into the office to Laura and say, hey, she''s wanting to add or she''s wanting to do. And so, you know, Laura''s making note of that. In the meantime, we''ve got somebody coming back to the yard to pick up whatever it is that they''re wanting to add and take it to the site so that it can be done at that time. Do they ever not call Laura and they just do it? Yes. Yes. If it''s, you know, if they''ve taken, well, not even if they''ve taken extra, there are times when the customer will ask for something and, you know, Kyler, you know, will come back, grab it and take it. And then after the fact, you know, it''s on the foreman''s report and she''s like, well, what is this? It wasn''t on the estimate. Well, they wanted it, you know, when we got there or she said this before we left. Yeah, that happens a lot. Does it ever not make it on the foreman''s report? Yes. Yeah. Yes. All right. Yes. And I think it''s probably just in, you know, everybody''s trying to do what, you know, what we''ve got laid out and it''s just in the middle of it and they just, you know, forget to write it down or, you know, it''s just not accounted for or whatever, but it''s not often, but it does happen. Anything else going on just in the general process? No, I mean, that''s because once it gets to the point of the final invoice being sent to the customer, then it''s, you know, then it''s just accounts receivable collecting on that invoice. And then the process just starts over, you know. Now, once the one thing that we do that I request just from a financial perspective and the way QuickBooks handles things is if we create an estimate and the customer approves that estimate and we collect the deposit on that estimate, then if they call a couple of days later and say, oh, well, I want to add such and such or I want you to give me a quote on such and such, then I have Laura go in and create a whole new estimate because we''ve already applied a payment to that specific transaction because the way QuickBooks works is once it''s been approved and accepted, then it has to be converted to an actual invoice. So once it becomes an actual invoice, then it starts hitting my financials. And so if I apply a payment to it, but then you go in and you start adding to it, then things are wonky. So we do have, you know, those instances where we''ve already started this estimate. Oh, well, now I want to add this, but we just do it as a completely new estimate just to keep the books clean. Other than those pieces, it''s really, really that. That is the hiccup in the whole process. To me, it''s not even the whiteboard. You know, it''s not that. It''s communication for number one. And then, you know, well, I guess communication is really it across the board because if anything is changed and it''s not communicated to Laura, then she doesn''t know to revise it. If the guys do something in the field and doesn''t tell Laura or Kyler or myself, then again, here we are, you know, chasing tail. Well, what I can tell you is that landscapers pretty much across the board all have a service component to their business. Whether they work with production builders or not, service is always going to be a big part of landscaping, more so than pretty much any other trade I work with, just because it''s really, really easy to basically install landscapes and then build a relationship with the customer and retain that business as a regular business, right? Right, right. And the landscapers I''ve worked with have been very successful using our system for the things that you''re describing, especially when it comes to communication breakdowns. Because whenever you change something in the system, it changes on a global scale. So if Kevin needs to reschedule a job in the field from the mobile app, that''s going to automatically update on your schedules in the office. But we can also, again, pictures and documentation. We can put these forms that you guys are using to build your estimates. We can template that out in our system so that Kevin can just draw on a PDF in our app, make the notes, check off boxes, send that to you guys. We even have talk-to-text, which I think is what we would push him to use. He would not, I can tell you. He won''t do it. He won''t click a button and just talk to the phone rather than type it. No, I''m sure he will not. Hey, you know what? There''s a first time for everything, and he may prove me 100% wrong. Well, I find it interesting that he would push you to take a look at a software system, but he''s not willing to use the software. Yeah, no, I completely agree. Yeah, I mean, we brought an operations manager on board to identify efficiencies or inefficiencies, and he ain''t here no more. And I''m just being, I mean, I am very black and white. There''s no gray area, you know, so I''m not about to waste your time or anything. No, you''re good. So I want you to know what it is. I would love to know who he talked to who pushed him toward this because that would help me a lot in just being like, I mean, I can tell you whoever you talk to is using the system this way, and they''re successful because of it. And I will definitely try to find out. But you know what? Let''s say for the sake of argument that he says, okay, I''ll do that. I''ll use talk to text. I use talk to text every single day of my life, and it''s great. It saves me a lot of keystrokes. It saves me a lot of time. We have this really cool ability. So in the mobile app, you can have documents, right, and you can edit these documents. And there''s a specific thing you can do where you can actually, on that document, you can record a voice note, right? So if he''s drawing and doing his little things with his pencil on his iPad, he could record a voice note rather than like jotting all of this down like freehand. And then you guys in the office would just have to listen to his voice rather than try to read what he''s trying to put down. Yeah, almost like dictation. Absolutely. That would be great. Yeah. And I feel like he''s got to be able to do that for you guys more so than for himself. So let me ask you this. Okay, so say we do this, and I know that you''ve said that the translation, and this is a big thing on my mind because all of our guys, we have a couple that can speak decent English, but they don''t always understand English so well. So if they''re in the field and they do a note and they do it, you know, speaking the note, and that comes across, we''re able to hear that in English? That translation works like that? No, I''m really hoping that we get to a point where like this new AI kick will allow us to start incorporating stuff like that because it''s pretty close. There''s some cool stuff happening with artificial intelligence. But right now we haven''t incorporated that or it''s not there yet from a technological standpoint. When it comes to like translation is one, there''s a couple different ways to look at this. One, we can have it to where all the hard-coded fields in our app translate to Spanish so that it''s easy for them to navigate. And then on the flip side, we''re also putting a lot of like we''re templating out a lot of things so that your guys don''t have to put in as many notes. They just have to click buttons, right? So when we build out forms or whatnot, it''s less of them having to jot notes down and more of them just saying, yes, I did this. No, this wasn''t there. So like a drop-down box. Exactly. And that''s something we put into Spanish so that it''s... Okay, so it''s put in Spanish. Okay, okay. I was going to say, okay, so if they check this box, I used four blue plumbagos and 16 foxtail ferns, and they put that in English because their numbers, it''s crazy. It''s not always in English. So as long as when we get it in the office, we''re able to see it in English and it''s correct, then that would be great. Yeah, because we have about 65 companies in Texas alone and then companies through New Mexico, Arizona, California, and we have no issue with the Spanish-English communication. Okay, that''s awesome. Awesome. Okay, that''s good. Any other questions? So this... product communicates with QuickBooks. So how would that work? So would we still maintain QuickBooks for billing and all of that? Or is this a replacement of QuickBooks? No, it''s not a replacement. We are not an accounting system. We do everything from the start of a project to up into billing, right? So we can create invoice drafts out of Bolt. You can manage your contracts and your items, like how much we''re going to charge for this. You can basically, for your situation, build an estimate in our system. And then when it comes time to bill on that final estimate, you could push the information from Bolt to QuickBooks so you''re not doing duplicate data entry. Okay, so let me back up for just a second so I understand. So the estimate process, Kevin has his tablet or whatever. Is it a tablet or is it just his phone? It could be a tablet or a phone. I would probably recommend a tablet for the fact that he''s drawing. Just give him more real estate to work with. But if he has a phone, we can make that work. Okay, so he has his device. He goes to the customer. So we put the customer database into, or is he actually signing on to Bolt, which is tied to QuickBooks and our customer information is feeding across from there? Or how does the customer information get? Let me back up. My brain is getting ahead of my mouth. No, you''re good. I know where you''re going, and I can explain it to you, but it''s going to be a lot easier to look at it from a visual perspective. Okay. And I think I''m confident that we can help you guys out at this, based on everything you''ve told me, your process, the challenges within your process. I think it would be best to schedule out a demo. Okay. My teammate Chrissy is our product expert. She demos Bolt. My job is just to make sure all your questions get answered and kind of just manage this process that we''re in. But the next step from here would be to schedule out that demo so you can take a look at it. I would probably say just keep it to you for now. Okay. If you like what you see, you think it''s something that could work for the team, let''s schedule out a second demo with the rest of the team once you''re confident. Okay, yeah. What do you think? Yeah, that sounds great. I think there''d be mass confusion if we did it any other way. Cool. And then you can also, like, if you like it, you can also guide us and be like, okay, let''s maybe not get too deep on this process. Let''s focus more on this thing when we talk with Kevin, stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Cool. So I am out of town next week for that vacation. Okay. Would you be okay scheduling something for, like, the first week of June? Yeah, that''s perfectly fine. Next week is actually month end for me, so not just month end, quarter end, month end. So I''ll be kind of busy next week anyway. Okay. What day would work best for you that week? Let me see. Hang on one second. Okay. I''ll tell you what, because that first week of June is a payroll week for me, can we do it the week of the 9th? Like that Tuesday the 10th would be okay. Okay. I''m going to make a note to give you a shout that Monday just to make sure nothing has come up crazy. Okay. But let''s go ahead and put something tentative on for that Tuesday. What time specifically would work best for you? If we could do around two, the afternoons seem to be a little bit better for me than the mornings. Chrissy, you have a dentist appointment at 2.30? Can we do one o''clock? Yeah, one will be fine. One will be great. All right. I will get that demo sent out, and then I''ll get Chrissy notes from this conversation so that she''s fully prepped up to address a lot of what we talked about, and we''ll just kind of go from there. Okay, awesome, Tim. Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing what you guys got. Yeah, I appreciate all the information. I love how you walked me through your company and just all the details of it. It''s awesome. Yeah, and that''s just high level. Wait till you really see it. You guys are an incredibly complex organization, but I work with landscapers all the time. Okay, well, that''s great. I''ll be honest. You are my second favorite trade to work with. Oh, wow. Okay, awesome. Plumbing is my favorite. Really? Yeah. Wow. It''s the most complex trade type out there, and just every single business is so incredibly different for the exact same kind of trade. Oh, my gosh. I''ve worked with more plumbing companies than I''ve worked with any trade at this point. Landscapers are definitely up there as well, though. Oh, gosh. Wow. Okay, well, I look forward to it, and I really thank you for your time and your knowledge and expertise and listening. For sure. Yeah, no, I mean, that''s the only way this thing works, right? Right, right. There''s a lot of BS software out there, and we''re just trying to make sure that we don''t rope anybody around. Right. Well, let me ask you just a ballpark high-level question. Go in the direction that we were talking about, just getting us to where the mass confusion is less confusion. Ballpark average, what does this run roughly? How many total employees do you have? That would be using the program or company-wide? We''ll probably have a better idea of who''s going to use the program once we get to the demo. You''ll have a much better idea of who needs to have access to it, but how many people in office do you guys have? Altogether, we probably have about 40. 40 total employees? Yeah. And then do you subcontract any work? It''s kind of seasonal, so in the wintertime we may have less, because again, all of our lawn and landscape, I don''t want to say all, but 22 of them are H-2A visa workers, so they all go home in November. So, yeah, but during peak season, February to October, November, we''re running about 40. Okay. I''d say we''d probably be in the ballpark of $1,000 to $1,500 a month with that user count. It could be more, it could be less. Again, you''ll have a much better idea of how many people need to have access to the system once you get an idea of how everything functions, but my recommendation is you definitely want everybody in the office to have access to the system. Any field supervisors, Kevin for sure, and then typically your crew leads will have access so that you have somebody that''s able to clock crews in, take pictures, stuff like that. Okay. Yeah, that''s still going to be a pretty good number, but yeah, we can definitely look at that. I mean, obviously later, but that''s a good ballpark to have because he''ll ask, you know, so I can at least say roughly, you know, given certain dynamics or whatever, this is apt to change. Yeah, and just so you know, all of our pricing is based on users. There''s a flat fee for the software system, and then there''s a user fee, and then we do have an implementation and training fee, and there''s three different packages you guys can choose from on that front. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Well, perfect. Perfect. All right. Well, I look forward to the demo. Awesome. I''m looking forward to just seeing if we can help you guys out and everything. Awesome. All right, Tim. Well, you enjoy your vacation and the holiday, and congratulations to you and your wife. I appreciate it. Enjoy your weekend, all right? You too. All right. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Tim from Bolt Software reached out to Sabrina at Southern Lawn and Landscape to discuss their software solution for streamlining operations.

Hey, good afternoon, Julia. My name is Hector. I''m with UCI Manufacturing Job Boss. How are you doing?

With who?

Job Boss.

Oh, Job Boss.

Yeah, I was reaching out to introduce myself. I think you had spoken with my colleague, Hannah. I just took over her territory and just wanted to introduce myself and let you know I''d be your first point of contact regarding any support regarding Job Boss. Yeah, just kind of wanted to see where you guys were at and see how the search was going for ERP solutions.

Let''s see. Actually, if you can do a Zoom presentation, are you available today?

Zoom presentation? So I''m the scheduler for the solutions expert, Holly. I can take a look if she''s available today. Give me one second here. What time were you looking at?

Maybe within an hour or two.

Oh, she''s pretty. Let me see. Give me one second. Let me see if she responds real quick. But yeah, I kind of just wanted to learn a little bit more about what you guys are doing. I have some pretty good notes here regarding kind of what you guys are looking for. Anything top of mind? Anything particularly you''d like to share? So we''re a CNC machine shop. Correct. And it''s a small size. I think for the ERP system, we''re looking for something that''s efficient. But I''m not too sure if we really need the ERP system since we''re really small. Okay. How many employees are we talking here? We have six. Okay. We''re actually made specifically for medium to small size job shops manufacturing. Are you guys mainly doing custom made to order things or made to stock? Yeah, made to order, made to stock, mostly prototypes. Mostly prototypes. Okay. And what are some of the challenges you guys are currently facing? What are you guys currently using? We don''t need an ERP right now. I''m just getting orders through emails or we use platforms. Okay. I think what I want is something a little bit more efficient. I know that maybe JobBoss offers something where I can tag material, tag my travelers. Correct. Yeah. And I see you guys are looking to pursue AS9100 certification and ITAR registration. Yeah, we''re pursuing that right now. Nice. Let''s see here. So what percent would you say it''s made to order for you guys? 100%. Perfect. And is it just one location we''re talking here? One location. Okay. And are you guys needing integrated financials, production forecasting, or warehouse management? No. Okay. And kind of what you guys are doing, I know you''re CNC machining. How complex are your bill of materials? Or do you guys have any sub-assemblies, anything like that? No assembly. If it''s simple assembly, not welding or... Yeah. Okay. She currently has back-to-back meetings the rest of the day. Let''s see here. Did you have some availability maybe tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Do you have a number at the top of your head how much it will cost monthly? Not necessarily. For a small business? She could go over that with you. She could ballpark it for you in that conversation. So just for full transparency, kind of the way we go about how we do this is I''m the scheduler, like I said, a scheduled call with Holly, which is a solutions expert, for a discovery call, just kind of seeing if we''re a right fit for you guys. And then if you see some value there, it''ll proceed to a demo. Okay. A demo based on that discovery conversation. That''s why we like to have those, just so we''re not wasting your guys'' time, trying to show you a demo that wouldn''t make sense if we''re not a fit for you guys and if we don''t know some more details about the business. But yeah, if you see some value in that conversation, then we''ll proceed to a demo. In that actual discovery call, you could go over pricing, ballpark pricing, as well as she''ll show you some of the job boss aspect of it. She''ll kind of show you the software, kind of how it works. But the demo, if you decide to go forward with the demo, that''s where you''ll see more in depth. But those questions she could definitely answer for you in the discovery call. Okay, sounds good. What time do you have some availability for tomorrow? I can do 11. 11 a.m.? Let me double check. She is busy. She''s one of our busier reps. Let''s see here. Did you have some time for tomorrow? She has availability for tomorrow at either 8 a.m. or what is this? 2 p.m. 2.30 as well as 3. If anything, I''ll just give you a call back to schedule this. Okay. Okay, thank you. Okay, bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Is Wayne around?

Yes, just a minute.

Hello?

Hey Wayne, it''s Kayla over with ECI. You remember me?

Oh yes, yes.

Perfect. How was Europe?

Good, good, yeah. Can''t complain. I mean, sometimes it gets like too hot, you know? Right. But yeah, no, it''s nice to get away and, you know, can''t be just chilling out on the Mediterranean and yeah, it''s hard to beat that. Yeah, it''s, yeah. I still haven''t made it over there, but the furthest I''ve been was Africa and that was a really fun trip. We did like a safari thing, but well good. Glad that you''re getting back into the swing of things. So I was just calling to see how the calendar''s looking and if we could maybe carve out some time, you know, Wednesday or Thursday, maybe like 15 minutes for a phone call. Yeah, I don''t think my position has changed at all, unfortunately. Yeah, we''re just, you know, we''re sort of just cruising along with our old system. Yeah, I don''t think there''s anything in like, you know, there''s no sort of urge to change at this point in time. I mean, unless something really like goes haywire with this software. I mean, the whole point of changing it was that we were losing support for this system. Like the guy or the guys that programmed it, he passed away and then, you know, we were kind of, we were concerned about like, you know, like support and like going forward and stuff. And then plus like actually that we know there was some exciting features that we were going to enjoy with the ECI system. But at the end of the day, it just got like too much for what we were trying to, what we were going to use it for. And so far the old system has hung in there. So it''s almost like until something really, really goes haywire, I don''t know if we''re going to do anything. That makes sense. I have no problem with that. Obviously, you guys know the best thing. I really just like the initial phone call really is just like to give you like an idea of what''s new. And like, it''s more of a brainstorming networking type of thing rather than a sales call. So that''s what I was going to set you up with is just something quick. He can kind of go over like what''s been new because it''s been many years since we''ve kind of showed you from my records. It''s many years since we''ve showed you like kind of what our system can do. We''re also significantly cheaper now. There''s just like a lot of updates. So yeah, that''s the initial call is just more of a, I don''t know, I''d say more of like a networking and informational thing. And then if you don''t find it valuable or whatever, you''re still kind of in the same boat, then we''re not going to be upset or anything like that. We''re not going to harass you. No, and it definitely wasn''t like a lack of like the system wasn''t going to be good. Like, you know, it''s just more or less like I said, until something really like critical happens, then we''re not going to like, in other words, we''re not going to like upset the apple cart here, which I, because I mean, yeah, we were pretty deep. We were pretty deep in the process. Like, you know, we had it all paid for and, you know, we were in the setup phase and like, you know, we were, I had tablets for all the guys that were going to punch in or clock in, clock out. Like, you know, we kind of had everything really going, but then it just like, you know, at the 11th hour, it was like, you know, this might just be like actually like too much like to take on at this point. And so we kind of just went back with the old system, you know, kind of just got cold feet and like, you know, just stuck with what works. Like we know where it works and we know that it''s kind of a little bit more bulletproof and like, and so, you know, until, yeah, I don''t think anybody really like, you know, unfortunately that''s just kind of, I guess how things work is, you know, unless something blows up, then it''s, you know. But yeah, I mean, I did like the, I did like some of the features and things. So, you know, I can definitely be down for like a quick, you know, just like a refresher on like what it does or what''s new. And then I could put that in and just keep that in my back pocket, right? That''s kind of what I was thinking. Because that way, you know, if something does blow up, then you''re already like, okay, well, I already got this in my mind. So I can just have Matt do like a very like quick, like low pressure phone call sometime tomorrow. Do you have some time, maybe like 10, 1030, 11, somewhere in there? I''m going to be making sales calls tomorrow, so I will be out of the office. But Thursday and Friday, Monday, basically any day but tomorrow. Okay, let''s do Thursday. It looks like I''ve got like 1 p.m., so basically the same time I''m calling now. Yep, yep, that works. Okay, all right, I will do that. It''ll just, yeah, like I said, it''ll just be a quick little phone call and Matt will show you everything that''s kind of new, talk through workflows and things like that. And then we''ll go from there. And if we put it on hold for a while, no worries at all. Yeah, no, for sure, for sure. All right, well, yeah, thanks for reaching out. And yeah, I will hear from you guys on Thursday. Okay, all right, I''ll send you like a little invite. That way you''ve got like a little reminder, but it''ll just be a phone call. So yeah, all right, we''ll talk soon, Wayne. Very good, thanks. Thank you. All right, bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Kayla from ECI called Wayne at Industrial Surface Technologies to discuss scheduling a brief phone call to review updates to ECI''s system. Wayne explained his company’s reluctance to switch from their current system, citing past challenges and a preference for stability. Ultimately, they agreed to a low-pressure informational call on Thursday.

**Key Points:**  
• **Wayne''s Current System Preference:** Wayne''s company continues to use their old system despite previously considering ECI''s software. They decided against switching due to concerns about complexity and the stability of their current setup.  

• **Purpose of the Call:** Kayla emphasized the call would be informational, focusing on updates to ECI''s system, new features, and cost reductions, rather than a sales pitch.

He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, a window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The search function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but you have to search functionally. What version are you guys using now, is it 11 or 10? The server, okay, the workstation he''s on, let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm. His computer had been updated. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11, okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. It''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down here. Windows 11. I wonder if there''s... There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Real quickly here. I''ve seen the article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hotfixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hotfix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade type we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. A little bit behind, but that''s okay. I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, for platform requirements. Okay. And then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details. But it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? If that documentation is pretty straightforward. So is it just a client upgrade, or do we need to upgrade the server database, or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But, yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported, operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review, I see that you called in the past, support articles? Let me, I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start to create a case there, but I''m like I don''t even remember creating a case or an account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need? Yeah, let me just make sure, bin.illiam.twinoakstech.com. That''s your? That''s correct, yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t? Okay. Let me. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might can find out. Okay. Let''s think you submitted cases in the past. I think you do have access. You should be good. Okay. Let me see if I can just. Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah. Just going to do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay. I got the portal. Receive your request. Receive your password. Nice. Nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. Give it my vault. I''ll put it in our password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right. I''m going to send you an email right now. I''ll just get in. Okay. Okay. And yep, I''m in the customer portal now. So, I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Keep, yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information. If you need anything else, create a case, reach out, and we''ll take care of you. But thanks for giving us some time today. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one. You too. Bye-bye. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hi Robin, this is Diego with Job Boss Squared. How are you?

I''m good.

Good. I received a note from your end. I believe you were looking into our software solution, Job Boss Squared. Okay, great.

Are you the one who used to be E2 Shops?

Yeah, so we E2 and both Job Boss. So now we have Job Boss Squared, which is what, it''s a merge between E2 and Job Boss that we have now.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Cool. Well, I''m interested in getting a demo of your product with an actual person so they can answer questions while I''m looking at it.

Of course, yeah. So that''s typically what we do. So what we would do is just set up like a brief 20-30 minute conversation at first. And we have that with one of our consultants. They''re the experts pretty much in Job Boss Squared and can answer anything you need. So we dive in deeper, we understand your operations a little more in depth. And then, you know, of course, if it makes sense, we go from there and then we''d book like an hour long demo and stuff like that for you to see. So if that''s sort of where you find yourself, that''d be great. I''d definitely love to get something set up for you.

Yeah.

I would love to understand just in a nutshell, what is it that you do? I see the message here describing some discrete manufacturing, maybe more custom one-off jobs.

So I''m doing this from the outside. So I started, I didn''t start, I bought a machine shop with my now ex-husband 25 years ago. I have a degree in industrial management and he was a machinist. So we bought the company, made it successful. It''s very much, he''s 62 and it''s very much the business runs in his head.

Okay.

And my 25 year old son is now working there to take it over. He''ll be the fourth generation to own this business.

Okay, great.

Man and I were the third generation because he was, you know, the owner gave him a chance to buy it. Anyway, so Cameron''s 25 and he''s been working there and he realizes like we need technology. This can''t all be in dad''s head, right?

Yeah.

So he''s reaching out to me because I have expertise in, you know, software and business and manufacturing. So I said I''d look up some stuff. So I just want to preview it. I sent him the information as well. I sent him a link to your website, but I''d like to see it just so that I can like preview it and see if it makes sense, if it''s a fit for their business. Because he doesn''t get this technology stuff from his dad, right? He said like we''ll do it the old fashioned way forever. It''s all in my head and therefore I have all the power.

Oh no.

Yeah.

So as it goes in old manufacturing. Anyway, so I''d love to see it. I wouldn''t be the one buying it, but then eventually it would be Cameron making an appointment to, you know, see if it fits. I can''t really participate because I''m the outsider, but I just want to make sure that I''m sending him in the right direction before he spins his wheel.

That makes complete sense. And so, yeah, I mean, like I said, our process is quite simple. So no matter what it is, like if it''s just like if you were to buy tomorrow or if you were to just be doing this for general knowledge, our process just stays the same. So if you''d like, I''d be happy to set up that initial call. And in this case, his name is Nick Hart. He''s our consultant there in your area. So what we''ll do, like I said, is just have a conversation about it, understand the business. We need to make sure that it is going to be a good fit, right? We know it''s manufacturing. We know it''s custom work, but he''ll have a few questions for you, like you''ll have questions for him, and then we''ll go from there.

All right. Okay, sounds good. Yeah, because like Cameron, like if you said some, he wouldn''t even get the lingo. Like what is WIP?

Yeah, okay.

You know what I mean? Like he, because he''s just new.

Of course, we tend to make the process a little more, you know, friendly towards anyone. And what I mean by that is we have a whole like professional service team, implementation team that they''re, you know, they''re guiding you through the whole process. So we also have videos and brochures of everything, like demo videos of how do you use this module? How do you do here? What do you do here? So yeah, that''s down the road. We know that.

Yeah, I watched some E2 videos on YouTube, and the guy was like explaining the three different ways you can approach manufacturing, whether it''s custom made or if it''s, you know, off the shelf. And I''m like, this is exactly what, this would be good education for him just to watch those.

Yeah, yeah. So yeah, we''ll definitely get those to him at some point, whenever it makes sense. But yeah, so let me see here what I have for Nick Hart for us to at least kick off the conversation with him. Do you have a preference on time or any date specifically?

Not really. No, I''m able to schedule my own stuff.

We''ll make it work. Okay.

Yeah.

Okay, so Nick is out for the rest of the week. They''re at Fabtech, a sort of expo show in Chicago. So he''ll be back next week. We came for Monday, if that works for you sometime in the morning, like 11am.

The 15th at 11?

Yeah.

Yep, that works.

Okay, we''ll do that. And then what I will do is I''ll send out a Teams, we do it through Teams. Would that work for you?

Yep.

Okay. And then the email I have is Robin050163 at gmail.com. Is that a good email?

Yep.

Okay. Alrighty, well, you''ll see an email from my end here shortly with Nick''s information on there as well. So if you need anything beforehand, feel free to reach out. Other than that, we''ll talk to you next Monday.

Okay, great. Thank you so much.

Thank you for your time, Robin. Have a good day.

You too. Bye-bye.

Hey, good afternoon, Julia. My name is Hector. I''m with UCI Manufacturing Job Boss. How are you doing?

With who?

Job Boss.

Oh, Job Boss.

Yeah, I was reaching out to introduce myself. I think you had spoken with my colleague, Hannah. I just took over her territory and just wanted to introduce myself and let you know I''d be your first point of contact regarding any support regarding Job Boss. Yeah, just kind of wanted to see where you guys were at and see how the search was going for ERP solutions.

Let''s see. Actually, if you can do a Zoom presentation, are you available today?

Zoom presentation? So I''m the scheduler for the solutions expert, Holly. I can take a look if she''s available today. Give me one second here. What time were you looking at?

Maybe within an hour or two.

Oh, she''s pretty. Let me see. Give me one second. Let me see if she responds real quick. But yeah, I kind of just wanted to learn a little bit more about what you guys are doing. I have some pretty good notes here regarding kind of what you guys are looking for. Anything top of mind? Anything particularly you''d like to share? So we''re a CNC machine shop. Correct. And it''s a small size. I think for the ERP system, we''re looking for something that''s efficient. But I''m not too sure if we really need the ERP system since we''re really small. Okay. How many employees are we talking here? We have six. Okay. We''re actually made specifically for medium to small size job shops manufacturing. Are you guys mainly doing custom made to order things or made to stock? Yeah, made to order, made to stock, mostly prototypes. Mostly prototypes. Okay. And what are some of the challenges you guys are currently facing? What are you guys currently using? We don''t need an ERP right now. I''m just getting orders through emails or we use platforms. Okay. I think what I want is something a little bit more efficient. I know that maybe JobBoss offers something where I can tag material, tag my travelers. Correct. Yeah. And I see you guys are looking to pursue AS9100 certification and ITAR registration. Yeah, we''re pursuing that right now. Nice. Let''s see here. So what percent would you say it''s made to order for you guys? 100%. Perfect. And is it just one location we''re talking here? One location. Okay. And are you guys needing integrated financials, production forecasting, or warehouse management? No. Okay. And kind of what you guys are doing, I know you''re CNC machining. How complex are your bill of materials? Or do you guys have any sub-assemblies, anything like that? No assembly. If it''s simple assembly, not welding or... Yeah. Okay. She currently has back-to-back meetings the rest of the day. Let''s see here. Did you have some availability maybe tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Do you have a number at the top of your head how much it will cost monthly? Not necessarily. For a small business? She could go over that with you. She could ballpark it for you in that conversation. So just for full transparency, kind of the way we go about how we do this is I''m the scheduler, like I said, a scheduled call with Holly, which is a solutions expert, for a discovery call, just kind of seeing if we''re a right fit for you guys. And then if you see some value there, it''ll proceed to a demo. Okay. A demo based on that discovery conversation. That''s why we like to have those, just so we''re not wasting your guys'' time, trying to show you a demo that wouldn''t make sense if we''re not a fit for you guys and if we don''t know some more details about the business. But yeah, if you see some value in that conversation, then we''ll proceed to a demo. In that actual discovery call, you could go over pricing, ballpark pricing, as well as she''ll show you some of the job boss aspect of it. She''ll kind of show you the software, kind of how it works. But the demo, if you decide to go forward with the demo, that''s where you''ll see more in depth. But those questions she could definitely answer for you in the discovery call. Okay, sounds good. What time do you have some availability for tomorrow? I can do 11. 11 a.m.? Let me double check. She is busy. She''s one of our busier reps. Let''s see here. Did you have some time for tomorrow? She has availability for tomorrow at either 8 a.m. or what is this? 2 p.m. 2.30 as well as 3. If anything, I''ll just give you a call back to schedule this. Okay. Okay, thank you. Okay, bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Hector from Job Boss reached out to Julia to introduce himself as her new point of contact for ERP solutions. They discussed Julia''s CNC machine shop needs, the potential fit of Job Boss software, and scheduled a follow-up discovery call with a solutions expert to explore further details.

**Key Points:**  
• **Introduction and Role Transition:** Hector introduced himself as Julia''s new contact, taking over from his colleague Hannah, and explained his role in supporting her ERP solution needs.  

• **Business Needs and Challenges:** Julia shared details about her CNC machine shop, including its small size (6 employees), focus on prototypes, and pursuit of AS9100 certification and ITAR registration. She expressed interest in efficiency improvements but questioned the necessity of an ERP system.  

• **Next Steps and Scheduling:** Hector outlined the process for evaluating Job Boss, starting with a discovery call to assess fit and discuss pricing, followed by a potential demo. Julia tentatively agreed to schedule a call, with Hector planning to confirm availability.

How''s everybody doing over there? Yeah, TGIF it''s been a week Anywhere with its own year, I''m pretty sure so Hey guys I''m sorry. Are you guys in st. Louis or Jeff City? St. Louis Yeah, I was actually in Jeff City most of the week but back in the office today there you go Yeah, hey Robert. Good afternoon Hey, good afternoon Jeff I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know you there''s several people invited I''ll just let you you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off Okay, I''m not sure Who all is available on our end? Robert thanks for hopping on I think Andrews in another meeting and I''m not sure about David So it might just be us Yeah, just know that we are we''re using fathom We''re recording it so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join They can watch at their leisure. So Thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call evolution X It''s you guys have been going down this path a little bit trying to work with a Vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already. That''s fully vetted Everything that you''re looking to have in the solution. I think we have for you guys. So We wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you Jase CJ''s on the phone CJ comes from evolution X. I''m your account manager from the automate standpoint. I''m from just be Missouri Been doing this 39 years. So happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well But anyway, CJ is going to kind of go over the product in a little high level. Please ask questions This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward. So with that I''m gonna turn over to you CJ Yeah, so Chrissy Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team fairly extensively last year and There''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo But would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on evolution X like who we are How we work any of that type of stuff or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just The cliff notes, I mean give you 30,000 if you''re part of ECI you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So evolution X e-commerce is a b2b e-commerce software It''s been around about 17 years And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago and it was just because they had enough Customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that see I build an integration if it just made sense for them to buy us and so Now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates Division and customer base and so we''ve had several customers I don''t know throughout the last six months beginning to onboard and it''s been a lot of fun So just think of this as a robust b2b e-commerce software that would compete with any big-box player out there but we''re bringing it to the small medium-sized distributor within the ECI family awesome I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this So this demos for you guys stop me anywhere we can pivot I''m definitely gonna be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform But this is the flow that I''m gonna go through. I''ll show you some finished customer examples So you can get an idea of what this would look like we''ll give you a back-end overview and I''ll make a change on the home page of my website So you can see like what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage? some search functionality Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded You''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results Some marketing tools and then I will log in as a customer at the end So you can get a feel for what that''s gonna look like for your customers Okay So I pulled a few customer examples here Is that? Yes, sorry Okay, sorry misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here We design these in-house for you guys So the way this would work if you decide to go with evolution X Our design team consults with you and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do No custom design We can go a few different routes and I''ve pulled examples of each so that This is a fully custom homepage for a dealer that''s in the office supply space. They also sell some technology and other products as well. But I think from a design perspective, we can make this look any way you want it to look. Some people have a vision for what this dropdown might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side. A lot of different ways we can look to go about this, but I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology, any category of products, they should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for. So in this instance, you know, we''ll just go to printers. If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees, we can have as many or as few of these as you want. But again, ideally these customers are going to be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website. What if they, excuse me, what if they have a SKU and know exactly the product that they''re looking for? So manufacturer reference is searchable? 100%. So that''s where some of the search capability will come into play, where if you want them to be able to search by the product number, reference number, that can be done any way you guys want. We''ll have full flexibility over the search bar. Okay. So it can even like index the description for, I put in, you know, Dell 14 inch, 256 gig. It''s going to go, Hey, here''s five results that have those words in the description. It would pull up from the description, the category, the attributes, whatever fields we need to pull it from. Absolutely. So I''ll look to show you a few different ways we could leverage the search bar, but that''s certainly one of them. Now looking at less custom design, this website, one of our out of the box themes. So at a base level, we have some templates or themes we call them that we can spin up and essentially we would put your color scheme, your branding, your logo. We would put media in here from you guys, or we can supply it, but at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like. If you want to have a shop by brand, a banner running across the site. So anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has unique design. CJ, just a quick question. Going back to the search, searching functionality, one of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14 inch laptop, for example, it doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description. Did I hear you say that EvoX actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely. Keywords, attributes. So you can go back on any given product and there''s a field where you can say, we call it keywords, but if you type in a keyword and associate it with that product, it means that line of products will pop up whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it. And this, I think it''s important to note. I say that we''re a white glove service, but it''s your arm and arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really good customer success team helping you build this website. A lot of this is we''re going to train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck. Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future, we don''t want to stand in your way. But if you do want help with these things, you''ll have live chat support from us. You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that. If it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to pull up and search the way you want. But ideally, we''re going to help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live. That way the search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website. Awesome. Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up. They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little sub menus would pop up. So just giving you a feel for possibilities. I think we can design anything you guys would want. But this will be something to think about, Jeff and all of you as we go down this road. If you do want. customization, we''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team that way they can make recommendations and hear what you''re looking for and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. So now something way less glamorous is my demo store. I designed this so don''t judge me and I wouldn''t be the one designing your website but I''ll use this just to navigate and move some stuff around and go through the demo. Let me see I''m actually gonna log out of my user and I''ll log back into him in a second. Okay back into the website. So when you guys log in this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective. You''ll have access to some basic KPI and data reports. It''s at surface level. There''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you but at surface level you''ll see order conversions, how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly, weekly basis. You can drag and drop and move any of this around. Chat support again we do chat support US and UK hours so it''s not quite 24-7 but it''s close and these are actual solutions experts not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem. So if you have an issue you can chat our team. I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me and they can grab your screen, send you articles, jump on a call. This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform. If you see a new button somewhere this is a new feature we''ve added. We add features monthly. We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that and I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool. So most dealers would have us I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days. They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform and we can still do that if you want but it can be overkill for a lot of people. So we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into EvolutionX. So you can come in here and see how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest. What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at? Who''s the top users? You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website, how it''s trending and I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant. Search results. So this will be again giving you data on when people come to your site what keywords are they actually typing into the search bar. You might have something that is in your top ten that''s unexpected. Well when someone types that in you''re gonna want to make sure that the right products are popping up as we discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything we''ve shown at this point? Are you able to slice those? Sorry. Yeah I was gonna say are you able to slice those analytics down to like a from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day? Yep up here and yeah and you can make it a custom range if you if you Awesome. So that''s good. What else Jeff did you have a question? Yeah from the design perspective I''m curious of your approach is from our perspective do we create like a wireframe and give that to you guys so you kind of know what to go from or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times your designers put together some options and then we you know go through the approval process and editing process? Yeah it can go either way. I don''t think it hurts to have a wireframe but you don''t need one and our team is definitely not accustomed to having one. So see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it then certainly that helps but most people don''t. Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you and then we do go through an iterative process. So we''ll make a draft based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting and then we might have to revise it three or four times. Okay. So that''s standard practice but what I''ll show you next that Jeff has seen is once we build you this site you''re gonna have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes and so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I use this jump to button in the top left just because it''s quicker to get around. I''m gonna type in layouts. So after the site is built this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website. I''m gonna go into the home page. So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform but you don''t have to. Most of this is meant to be drag-and-drop no code and so we house all of the meat. You can certainly use Stripe. My store is actually set up with Stripe. But this is all the third party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services, HubSpot is a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here. But ideally, I don''t know, Craig can probably answer your questions about NetOne on a separate call. But if you wanted customers to obviously use NetOne or pay using ACH, those are things that can be done as well. But Stripe, very doable. OK, Chrissy, I''ll have some I get with you, Chrissy, on the NetOne side, because the majority of our clients do use NetOne and interfaces with the automate integrates, I mean, and also your customer e-info if you''re using that. So to me, it''s a no-brain, must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in. We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate-wise and get you what those percentages would be. But yeah, let me get you in touch with them, guys. OK. Great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not 100% what it would look like. This is a different ERP. But just on the customer portal end, when we do integrate this to e-automate, there will be an invoice history tab. And this is where they would come in and view their invoice history. Typically, these fields are clickable. When it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP, so if they wanted to actually hyperlink and click into that, they could see it. But it will pull the invoice history for on and offline orders. So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still going to pull that invoice history for them to do 24-7. So that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal. OK. I''m confused. I actually have two questions, CJ, one of which is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about. Do customers, shoppers, have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah. So we''ll show that. Chris, you said you''re confused? Yeah. Can you just recap this page that you''re on again? Yep. You lost me. It''s OK. No, that''s perfect. So Evolution X integrates with 30 different ERP systems. So e-automate is one. We work with a number of different. So the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to e-automate for that reason. So I have a demo store that has some fake data to where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in, they will have an invoice history tab. So this is where they would open that up, and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website. OK. I get it. The data doesn''t look, yeah, it doesn''t look exactly the same as what the e-automate data will look like because this is fake data. Just to give you an idea of what it would look like, they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up. But anyway, we''re going to feed all order. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history. And the reason that''s relevant is maybe, again, maybe they don''t buy online from you, but it can still access their invoice history without having to call you. So it''s going to pull all orders on and offline. Nice. That''s awesome. Now, your question, I''ll show you. Sorry. I''m just going to circle back to that one. So I''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart. So this is where, again, if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item, I could just open it up. Sorry, what were you about to ask? What was I going to ask? Sorry. Oh, yeah, no, it''s all good. I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps, and I heard MailChimp in there as well. Just curious about the integration of things like ConnectWise or Salesforce or Kaseya or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s what this looks like. EvolutionX is open API, so technically we can integrate with any third party app. If we don''t have an existing integration, it may take some dev work. So there may just be a cost associated with that. And Salesforce would be a big one. Like, we could integrate Salesforce, and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it. And so I think there''s a big one. business case there but the Salesforce is also very different for every company. The way we use Salesforce at ECI might be very different than you guys and so it just takes a little bit of the answer is yes but there would be a dev cost associated with it and I couldn''t even tell you what that is those kind of are done case by case. Okay, but the capabilities there. Yeah we can we can''t do it so the platform is built to integrate. Okay and so for guest users we can you know hide publish pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog. Thousand percent. You can customize this. Okay. Yep based off of what their role is and it''s all check boxes for the most part like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing you would just uncheck a box. What about like margin and markup rules I''m assuming we can do that for company per customer can we do it like how complicated can we get with the rules like can we say hey do 20% unless that puts it over MSRP things like that. That''s typically data we pull from eAutomate. So if you''re talking to the basic level right like you could call it contract pricing every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product. That''s all data that we pull real time from eAutomate. Now you could you could do it in Evolution X as well just in order some ERPs are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website it has to match something you have in the ERP to for it to like push over correctly but the answer is yes. I don''t know if I''m making sense on that explanation. I''m not an eAutomate user so I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not. It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of eAutomate on our side. At a basic level the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing at a hundred percent that is I would say a table stakes feature of Evolution X. What other questions do you guys have? I can show you the blog feature if you mentioned that the AI blog. I don''t know Jeff that might just be your thing but I''ll probably be supporting it a little bit but I think it''s exciting for the people on the call to just see how we can truly like reinforce the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah two things I''ll show you. Something that is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer and both are pretty cool. So I feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other ecommerce products in the market and I do think we''re doing the most with AI. This is the first thing we did about a year ago where give me a blog title anybody. Benefits of what? Go for it. Go for it Robert. Benefits of Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6 like this? Yep. Cool okay I''ll type in the title you can make the tone professional, casual, funny. We''ll do funny. You can adjust the word length. Ask EvoXAI and it''s gonna start to spit out your blog for you. Now you''re going to want to proofread it but the results it does spit out are pretty remarkable. Ideally it''s trying to take away 70% of the lead time of writing a blog. Now once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look it will do the excerpt for you. It will do the meta information for search engine optimization and kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating the buyer on how to buy office furniture. If you wanted to link products into the blog this is just where you would come in and I''m just gonna type in random numbers. You would type in the SKU part number, the name, whatever and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog. So that''s just one example. Chat GPT is baked in here too so if you needed ideas for a blog title you could just you could type that in and have it give you ideas. So that''s current state but I will show you I think I have some slides here in this deck. Yes here we go. So we are adding copilot to the platform. customers in data testing right now. But this will be a full. AI assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well. And Jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this cause it''s. It''s pretty new, but. In this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month? It pulled that data. You tell it to create a 10% discount code for those items and emit best sellers of the month. So it will go do that for you and it will say can you essentially? Can you make a marketing page based off of these best sellers? Don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you. That you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website. That''s insane, that''s awesome, yeah, so I''ve got a few examples in this slide deck, but I think you get the point. Like any business data you want to pull. Gross revenue or if you wanted to extend contracts as an example. This will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys, and that''s again. We''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but. This is the direction it''s going. So. Lots of cool stuff with AI. Yeah, another question that is probably important to talk about is is deal registration. Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m not Craig might be, but yeah, fill me in. Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure, so a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers. They want to be able to forecast it, and so they will do partner initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing. OK, those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days. And once we have that by saying, hey, customer ABC is going to buy 100 Dell laptops over the next six months. They go cool, that''s awesome. Your new price for them is this. OK, and ideally it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh yeah, yeah, OK cool. And so what''s your thought on like? What do you want to do with that information on the ecommerce platform? Well, I mean we we pass you know some of the savings along, but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time. There''s not much in the IT. Marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre negotiated markup you''re always going to end up with these these deal regs and big deal pricing type of. Got it, so I''m going to show you. I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting. So it''s not just the pricing, but you''re wanting to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain time frame. Um, I believe so. Yeah, like if we could have something like your price, which is good through. You know March 31st or something like that. OK so. Two thoughts on this and I''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do so. The first thing you could do is make a promotion. In the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example. I could say 10% off. February and again like this is a generic title, but this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and stop dates for the promotion. So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates, you could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer. And then you would select a promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting $1 amount offer or percentage off, which would be within these dates you''ve got a 10% discount. It''s going to generate a coupon code. Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe. Only five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend $300 to qualify. None of this might be relevant to your. Example, but you can set rules and conditions and then whatever promotion you''re running, you would just apply it across a group of products. You apply that to a specific customer, though, because these are customer specific. Yes, you can apply.

Is Wayne around?

Yes, just a minute.

Hello?

Hey Wayne, it''s Kayla over with ECI. You remember me?

Oh yes, yes.

Perfect. How was Europe?

Good, good, yeah. Can''t complain. I mean, sometimes it gets like too hot, you know. But yeah, no, it''s nice to get away and, you know, can''t be just chilling out on the Mediterranean and yeah, it''s hard to beat that.

Yeah, I still haven''t made it over there, but the furthest I''ve been was Africa and that was a really fun trip. We did like a safari thing, but well good, glad that you''re getting back into the swing of things. So I was just calling to see how the calendar is looking and if we could maybe carve out some time, you know, Wednesday or Thursday, maybe like 15 minutes for a phone call.

Yeah, I don''t think my position has changed at all, unfortunately. Yeah, we''re just, you know, we''re sort of just cruising along with our old system. Yeah, I don''t think there''s anything in like, you know, there''s no sort of urge to change at this point in time. I mean, unless something really like goes haywire with this software. I mean, the whole point of changing it was that we were losing support for this system. Like the guy or the guys that programmed it, he passed away and then, you know, we were kind of, we were concerned about like, you know, like support and like going forward and stuff. And then plus like actually that we know there was some exciting features that we were going to enjoy with the ECI system. But at the end of the day, it just got like too much for what we were trying to, what we were going to use it for. And so far, the old system has hung in there. So it''s almost like until something really, really goes haywire, I don''t know if we''re going to do anything.
Okay, that makes sense. I have no problem with that. Obviously, you guys know the best thing. I really just like the initial phone call really is just like to give you like an idea of what''s new. And like, it''s more of a brainstorming networking type of thing rather than a sales call. So that''s what I was going to set you up with is just something quick. He can kind of go over like what''s been new because it''s been many years since we''ve kind of showed you from my records. It''s many years since we''ve showed you like kind of what our system can do. We''re also significantly cheaper now. There''s just like a lot of updates. So yeah, that''s the initial call is just more of a, I don''t know, I''d say more of like a networking and informational thing. And then if you don''t find it valuable or whatever, you''re still kind of in the same boat, then we''re not going to be upset or anything like that. We''re not going to harass you.
No, and it definitely wasn''t like a lack of like the system wasn''t going to be good. Like, you know, it''s just more or less like I said, until something really like critical happens, then we''re not going to like, in other words, we''re not going to like upset the apple cart here, which I, because I mean, yeah, we were pretty deep. We were pretty deep in the process. Like, you know, we had it all paid for and, you know, we were in the setup phase and like, you know, we were, I had tablets for all the guys that were going to punch in or clock in, clock out. Like, you know, we kind of had everything really going, but then it just like, you know, at the 11th hour, it was like, you know, this is, this might just be like actually like too much like to take on at this point. And so we kind of just went back with the old system, you know, kind of just got cold feet and like, you know, just stuck with what works. Like we know where it works and we know that it''s kind of a little bit more bulletproof and like, and so, you know, until, yeah, I don''t think anybody really like, you know, unfortunately that''s just kind of, I guess how things work is, you know, unless something blows up, then it''s, you know, but, but yeah, I mean, I did like the, I did like some of the features and things. So, you know, I can definitely be down for like a quick, you know, just like a refresher on like what it does or what''s new. And then I could put that in and just keep that in my back pocket. Right.
That''s kind of what I was thinking. Cause that way, you know, if something does blow up, then you''re already like, okay, well, I already got this in my mind. So I can just have Matt do like a very like quick, like low pressure phone call sometime tomorrow. Do you have some time, maybe like 10, 1030, 11, somewhere in there?
I''m going to be making sales calls tomorrow, so I will be out of the office. But Thursday and Friday, Monday, basically any day but tomorrow.
Okay. Let''s do, let''s do Thursday. It looks like I''ve got like 1pm. So basically the same time I''m calling now.
Yep. Yep. That works.
Okay. All right. I will do that. It''ll just, yeah, like I said, it''ll just be a quick little phone call and that will show you everything that''s kind of new and talk through workflows and things like that. And then we''ll go from there. And if we put it on hold for a while, no worries at all.
Yeah, no, for sure. For sure. All right. Well, yeah, thanks for reaching out. And yeah, I will hear from you guys on Thursday.
Okay. All right. I''ll send you like a little invite. That way you''ve got like a little reminder, but it''ll just be a phone call. So yeah. All right. We''ll talk soon, Wayne.
Very good. Thanks.
Thank you. All right. Bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Kayla from ECI contacted Wayne to discuss the possibility of revisiting their software system. Wayne explained that his company is still using their old system due to its reliability and the challenges they faced during the transition process with ECI''s system. Kayla proposed a low-pressure informational call to update Wayne on new features and pricing, which he agreed to schedule for Thursday.

**Key Points:**  
• **Wayne''s Current System Status:** Wayne''s company continues to use their old software system, as it remains functional and reliable. They previously considered switching to ECI but decided against it due to the complexity and timing of the transition.  

• **Purpose of Kayla''s Call:** Kayla emphasized that the call was not a sales pitch but an opportunity to provide updates on ECI''s system, including new features and reduced pricing, to keep Wayne informed for future reference.  

• **Scheduled Follow-Up:** Wayne agreed to a quick informational call on Thursday at 1 PM, where ECI will provide an overview of updates and discuss workflows. Kayla will send a calendar invite as a reminder.

Well, then just a quick refresher. Work with businesses closely like yours to just kind of help simplify operations, kind of making this day-to-day task a little bit easier.

And everything been working good for you so far with that? Okay, perfect. I do know that Epicor Eagle is kind of going end of life in 2026, so just want to have that top of mind. I know that they have some other options available. They do, yeah. BizTrack or this or that. Yeah, totally know that you guys already use them, all that, but do the same thing kind of in the lumberyard area as well. So kind of when that time comes, we''d love to just like send over an email just so you have my information, some information about Spruce too, just so you have all the options open. Okay. Yeah, we''re actually looking at another one called Flitch. Have you ever heard of that? To be so honest with you, no. I''m pretty new, so I don''t know all of them. I actually have a meeting with him on September 9th to look at their system. So, yeah. Is that just kind of the accounting and all that aspect? Yeah. Okay. And are you looking at that one because of anything with Epicor Eagle right now, like something not working completely right? Eagle is so antiquated, you know. Yeah. It''s old, it''s clumsy, it''s not user-friendly like some of the other ones, you know. They''re more, their searches are easier the way they do them now for product searches and whatnot and the way they gather information and the way we bring in information in from vendors and, you know, have it streamlined into, you know, POs and whatnot. Yeah, so we''re looking, but just not anything real readily something we''re going to do tomorrow, you know. Yeah, no, totally understand. Next year, the following year or whatever, but keeping my eyes open. Yeah, totally get that, no hurry, but definitely would love to be in that aspect just so you can kind of see all your options, maybe see a demo over here as well of just kind of what we do, kind of built by like lumber yards and builders, so definitely streamlines really well with kind of the PO, the accounting. I know some people are kind of interested in getting to like the e-commerce side as well just because everybody loves to shop online now, so we do have that street lighting over here as well if that''s ever an interest. What about rental? Does it integrate with rental, total rental? Because we have a rental store here as well. Just to add another little element to it. I will double check on that. I will literally double check as soon as we get off that phone. Not 100% sure, so I don''t want to tell you something and then be incorrect, but I can find out and then send an email over to you kind of with the information about Spruce, all that type of stuff. See if you''d want to maybe learn a little bit more, but can answer that question in the email as well. Just don''t want to give you something and then be wrong. Sure. Awesome. Do you have my email then? Yeah, let me double check that I have the correct one on file. I just have Corey at LloydLumberCo.com. That''s me. Okay, perfect.

Grace Burks from ECI Spruce contacted Corey Ness at Lloyd Lumber to discuss potential software solutions for managing sales and inventory.

• **Current System at Lloyd Lumber:** Corey shared that the company uses Epicor Eagle, which is functional but outdated, clunky, and not user-friendly. They are exploring alternatives like Flitch to improve efficiency.  

• **Future Plans and Considerations:** Corey mentioned that Lloyd Lumber is not in a rush to switch systems but is keeping options open for the next year or two. Grace highlighted Epicor Eagle''s end-of-life in 2026 and suggested Spruce as a potential solution tailored for lumberyards and builders.

Our menu options have recently changed. For reception, please press 1. For service and warranty, press... Your call is being transferred. Please hold. TC Electric, this is Sarah. Hey Sarah, is Randy in by chance? Yeah, one second please. TC Electric, this is Randy. Hey Randy, it''s Ryan over at ECI. How are you doing today? Hey, I''m good. How are you? I''m good, thanks for asking. I was just following back up. You and I had spoke a few months back briefly about Bolt. We got that project management tool here for people that work with builders, and I just wanted to see if you guys would be open to a 10-minute call maybe next week to take a peek into it. Are you guys still doing quite a bit of new residential construction working with builders? Yeah, and I mean we use ECI for a lot of people. You might be thinking of our builder portal, so that''s for the builders. What we have is a product called Bolt. It takes all of those jobs out of those portals that you''re using for various builders. It puts them into one place, organizes everything. It also handles your crew scheduling, all the change orders. All the POs are just in one place. It also does inventory estimating, so it''s a big project management tool for kind of the whole operation. It might not make sense at first just trying to explain it, but I think once you take a look at it, it might give you an understanding of how it works, and then if you guys wanted to implement it down the road, obviously you could, but I at least wanted to show it to you next week if you had some time. I like the idea of it. I''m just trying to figure out how much of it we would actually end up using. What''s your volume looking like right now? How many homes would you say you''re doing a year, just if you had to guess? I don''t even think I could put a number on it. Over 300, would you say? Yeah. Because we work with about 1,000 crews nationwide, and we help different people with different things. Not everyone uses the inventory features, for example, but a lot of people use their scheduling with us on the app, or some people just want it to be more organized because all the job and field notes and photos, the guys can work off checklists in the field, and all those photos and things can be handy, and just having a place to put all the job folders into one place, and it''s all nice and neat, and I think if you saw it, how the software looks, I think it might kind of resonate with you and could definitely make your day-to-day a lot smoother. But again, not expecting you guys to implement this or purchase it by any means, more so just wanted to see if you wanted to take a look at it. What is the price for this? I''ll be honest. Just paying for the other portal that we use, what''s the difference between this and the regular ECI portal we pay for? I really don''t know. I don''t know how much that builder portal runs. Again, that''s more so for the builders. This is for you guys directly. I more so set up these introductory meetings, my expert Aaron. It would just be like a 10-minute call next week. He would just give you a high overview of what it does. He''d ask you some questions about your guys'' business, and if it makes sense, cool. If not, then no worries. It''d just be 10, 15 minutes of your time, but he could go over things like pricing, areas that we might be able to help you, and just at least show you what other people are using so you have an understanding of... Because this software was designed specifically for people that work with builders primarily. In fact, it was designed by an electrician out of Texas, so it''s built specifically for what you guys do. Down the road, if you''re looking to scale or just to be organized more overall, this could really be a handy tool. He has some availability, I''m showing, on Tuesday or Wednesday if you wanted to just have a 10, 15-minute chat about it. It would be over the phone? Yeah, so he would give you a call, this same number, or you can take your cell, whatever works best, and he would just kind of ask you some questions about the company. See if, show you how we''ve been able to help others, some of the companies just like you guys that were, you know, able to be more efficient, save on employee costs, and just manage everything from different scheduling features to you name it. But yeah, it would be a 15-minute call, and then if you wanted to see a demo, he would end up scheduling like a demonstration with you. But that first call is just more of an introductory alignment call to make sure it''s even a fit for you, something that makes sense for your company. What time is he available on Tuesday? Tuesday, we could do like 3 p.m. or 2 p.m. We could do 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Okay. And just to clarify, what is a good email address for you? It''s going to be tcadmin at tcelectricco.com. Okay. And what''s the best number for Aaron to give you guys a call at at 2? My direct line is 302-660-9424. 9424. Okay, perfect. I''m going to send you over a calendar invite to your email address here if you could just hit accept for me. And let''s see here. Your central time, you said? Is that right? Are you Eastern? Eastern. Okay, cool. And do you know how many builders that you''re working with right now by chance? Like that use ECI? No, don''t think so much ECI. ECI is just those builder portals. Like I''m sure you''re working with other builders that are using other portals or maybe you just get emails from them. So all your builders in total, it''ll take all of the jobs from all the different portals and put it into one place, not just the ECI one. I know it can be confusing until you see it, but it''s like it''s much more than just working with the ECI ITK builder portals. So as a whole, how many builders would you say that you work with? Oh my gosh. Maybe 20, 30. 20 or 30 builders. Okay. And if you had to guess how many jobs you guys do a year, this just helps us kind of prepare for the meeting. You said over 300? Yeah, definitely over 300. Okay. Maybe 500 or 1,000? Yeah, probably in that ballpark. Okay. And last question for you here. How many crews do you guys have? If we were going to maybe show you some of our scheduling features, how many crews, how many guys do you got in the field? We probably have like 50 or 60 vans that go out a day. 50 or 60 vans. So probably over 100 guys. We usually have like 100 is probably average. Okay, awesome. It might be a little less right now. We''re a little slow right now. Well, cool. We look forward to meeting with you, see if it could be a fit for you guys. And if there''s one thing we can kind of tailor the meeting to, maybe something that''s piqued your interest here on this call, is there anything that comes to mind as far as how Bolt could help you guys maybe streamline your operation? I mean, I''m just like right now we have a ton of different portals that we use for each builder. They all do the same thing, but it''s like catered to each builder. And I''m just, I don''t know. I guess if this Bolt thing can group them together somehow, then that would make it easier. That''s exactly what it does. And it would definitely organize your day-to-day. Are you guys currently using, outside of those builder portals, do you guys use any type of current software to manage your scheduling? Or is it still more so Google Calendars? We''re like very old school in a sense still. Like some of our portals we pull payment from, but mainly we just use them for purchase ordering. We take scheduling and put it on our own calendars from whatever the builder is scheduling, but we don''t like do scheduling as far as our crews and where they''re going. Okay. I would love to show you this because I think once you see it, I think it''ll click. That''s typically how it goes. It doesn''t make a lot of sense up front, but once you see how it will align the guys, how it brings all of the jobs into one place, the builder communication is just seamless through the software and just one place for all the jobs. It''ll make more sense on the call. Awesome, Randy. Thank you so much for your time. I have all of this notated. We''re going to give you a call next Tuesday at 2 p.m. is what I have written down. I''m going to send you over that calendar invite and we''ll talk more then. Thank you so much. You have a great day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey, good afternoon, Julia. My name is Hector. I''m with UCI Manufacturing Job Boss. How are you doing?

With who?

Job Boss.

Oh, Job Boss.

Yeah, I was reaching out to introduce myself. I think you had spoken with my colleague, Hannah. I just took over her territory and just wanted to introduce myself and let you know I''d be your first point of contact regarding any support regarding Job Boss. Yeah, just kind of wanted to see where you guys were at and see how the search was going for ERP solutions.

Let''s see. Actually, if you can do a Zoom presentation, are you available today?

Zoom presentation? So I''m the scheduler for the solutions expert, Holly. I can take a look if she''s available today. Give me one second here. What time were you looking at?

Maybe within an hour or two.

Oh, she''s pretty. Let me see. Give me one second. Let me see if she responds real quick. But yeah, I kind of just wanted to learn a little bit more about what you guys are doing. I have some pretty good notes here regarding kind of what you guys are looking for. Anything top of mind? Anything particularly you''d like to share? So we''re a CNC machine shop. Correct. And it''s a small size. I think for the ERP system, we''re looking for something that''s efficient. But I''m not too sure if we really need the ERP system since we''re really small. Okay. How many employees are we talking here? We have six. Okay. We''re actually made specifically for small size job shops manufacturing. Are you guys mainly doing custom made to order things or made to stock? Yeah, made to order, made to stock, mostly prototypes. Mostly prototypes. Okay. And what are some of the challenges you guys are currently facing? What are you guys currently using? We don''t need an ERP right now. I''m just getting orders through emails or we use platforms. Okay. I think what I want is something a little bit more efficient. I know that maybe JobBoss offers something where I can tag material, tag my travelers. Correct. Yeah. And I see you guys are looking to pursue AS9100 certification and ITAR registration. Yeah, we''re pursuing that right now. Nice. Let''s see here. So what percent would you say it''s made to order for you guys? 100%. Perfect. And is it just one location we''re talking here? One location. Okay. And are you guys needing integrated financials, production forecasting, or warehouse management? No. Okay. And kind of what you guys are doing, I know you''re CNC machining. How complex are your bill of materials? Or do you guys have any sub-assemblies, anything like that? No assembly. If it''s simple assembly, not welding or... Yeah. Okay. She currently has back-to-back meetings the rest of the day. Let''s see here. Did you have some availability maybe tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Do you have a number at the top of your head how much it will cost monthly? Not necessarily. For a small business? She could go over that with you. She could ballpark it for you in that conversation. So just for full transparency, kind of the way we go about how we do this is I''m the scheduler, like I said, a scheduled call with Holly, which is a solutions expert, for a discovery call, just kind of seeing if we''re a right fit for you guys. And then if you see some value there, it''ll proceed to a demo. Okay. A demo based on that discovery conversation. That''s why we like to have those, just so we''re not wasting your guys'' time, trying to show you a demo that wouldn''t make sense if we''re not a fit for you guys and if we don''t know some more details about the business. But yeah, if you see some value in that conversation, then we''ll proceed to a demo. In that actual discovery call, you could go over pricing, ballpark pricing, as well as she''ll show you some of the job boss aspect of it. She''ll kind of show you the software, kind of how it works. But the demo, if you decide to go forward with the demo, that''s where you''ll see more in depth. But those questions she could definitely answer for you in the discovery call. Okay, sounds good. What time do you have some availability for tomorrow? I can do 11. 11 a.m.? Let me double check. She is busy. She''s one of our busier reps. Let''s see here. Did you have some time for tomorrow? She has availability for tomorrow at either 8 a.m. or what is this? 2 p.m. 2.30 as well as 3. If anything, I''ll just give you a call back to schedule this. Okay. Okay, thank you.

Is Wayne around?

Yes, just a minute.

Hello?

Hey Wayne, it''s Kayla over with ECI. You remember me?

Oh yes, yes.

Perfect. How was Europe?

Good, good, yeah. Can''t complain. I mean, sometimes it gets like too hot, you know? But yeah, no, it''s nice to get away and, you know, can''t be just chilling out on the Mediterranean and yeah, it''s hard to beat that.

Yeah, I still haven''t made it over there, but the furthest I''ve been was Africa and that was a really fun trip. We did like a safari thing, but well good. Glad that you''re getting back into the swing of things. So I was just calling to see how the calendar''s looking and if we could maybe carve out some time, you know, Wednesday or Thursday, maybe like 15 minutes for a phone call.

Yeah, I don''t think my position has changed at all, unfortunately. Yeah, we''re just, you know, we''re sort of just cruising along with our old system. Yeah, I don''t think there''s anything in like, you know, there''s no sort of urge to change at this point in time. I mean, unless something really like goes haywire with this software. I mean, the whole point of changing it was that we were losing support for this system. Like the guy or the guys that programmed it, he passed away and then, you know, we were kind of, we were concerned about like, you know, like support and like going forward and stuff. And then plus like actually that we know there was some exciting features that we were going to enjoy with the ECI system. But at the end of the day, it just got like too much for what we were trying to, what we were going to use it for. And so far, the old system has hung in there. So it''s almost like until something really, really goes haywire, I don''t know if we''re going to do anything. That makes sense. I have no problem with that. Obviously, you guys know the best thing. I really just like the initial phone call really is just like to give you like an idea of what''s new. And like, it''s more of a brainstorming networking type of thing rather than a sales call. So that''s what I was going to set you up with is just something quick. He can kind of go over like what''s been new because it''s been many years since we''ve kind of showed you from my records. It''s many years since we''ve showed you like kind of what our system can do. We''re also significantly cheaper now. There''s just like a lot of updates. So yeah, that''s the initial call is just more of a, I don''t know, I''d say more of like a networking and informational thing. And then if you don''t find it valuable or whatever, you''re still kind of in the same boat, then we''re not going to be upset or anything like that. We''re not going to harass you. No, and it definitely wasn''t like a lack of like the system wasn''t going to be good. Like, you know, it''s just more or less like I said, until something really like critical happens, then we''re not going to like, in other words, we''re not going to like upset the apple cart here, which I, because I mean, yeah, we were pretty deep. We were pretty deep in the process. Like, you know, we had it all paid for and, you know, we were in the setup phase and like, you know, we were, I had tablets for all the guys that were going to punch in or clock in, clock out. Like, you know, we kind of had everything really going, but then it just like, you know, at the 11th hour, it was like, you know, this is, this might just be like actually like too much like to take on at this point. And so we kind of just went back with the old system, you know, kind of just got cold feet and like, you know, just stuck with what works. Like we know where it works and we know that it''s kind of a little bit more bulletproof and like, and so, you know, until, yeah, I don''t think anybody really like, you know, unfortunately that''s just kind of, I guess how things work is, you know, unless something blows up, then it''s, you know, but, but yeah, I mean, I did like the, I did like some of the features and things. So, you know, I can definitely be down for like a quick, you know, just like a refresher on like what it does or what''s new. And then I can put that in and just keep that in my back pocket. Right. That''s kind of what I was thinking. Cause that way, you know, if something does blow up, then you''re already like, okay, well, I already got this in my mind. So I can just have Matt do like a very like quick, like low pressure phone call sometime tomorrow. Do you have some time, maybe like 10, 1030, 11, somewhere in there? I''m going to be making sales calls tomorrow, so I will be out of the office. But Thursday and Friday, Monday, basically any day but tomorrow. Okay. Let''s do, let''s do Thursday. It looks like I''ve got like 1 p.m. So basically the same time I''m calling now. Yep. Yep. That works. Okay. All right. I will do that. It''ll just, yeah, like I said, it''ll just be a quick little phone call and that will show you everything that''s kind of new and talk through workflows and things like that. And then we''ll go from there. And if we put it on hold for a while, no worries at all. Yeah, no, for sure. For sure. All right. Well, yeah, thanks for reaching out. And yeah, I will hear from you guys on Thursday. Okay. All right. I''ll send you like a little invite. That way you''ve got like a little reminder, but it''ll just be a phone call. So yeah. All right. We''ll talk soon, Wayne. Very good. Thanks. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
Kayla from ECI called Wayne at Industrial Surface Technologies to discuss scheduling a follow-up call regarding ECI''s system updates.

Hey Josh, this is Jordan over at DCOM. How''s your Friday going so far? I''m sorry, you cut out. This is who from where? Jordan from DCOM. From DCOM? DCOM. DCOM. Does that ring a bell at all? No. Gotcha. No worries. Yeah, I know I''m calling you out of the blue here. I got sent over from my marketing team that you''d checked out one of our reports within, I think, Food Dive or maybe Food Manufacturing, just on manufacturing tipping points. So how to embrace disruption and that whole thing. So just wanted to reach out and kind of see what sparked the interest there and if it''s worth having a further conversation about your operation and kind of what we do. I think I remember opening some sort of article and then I got busy and never read it. Gotcha. Can''t tell you how many times I''ve done that. Like this week sometime? Yes, sir. I think it was a few days ago, if I''m not mistaken. Yeah, it sounds familiar, but I got busy and I ended up having to restart my computer, close all the tabs, and I didn''t even read it. Gotcha. Makes complete sense. Well, what do you do? What do you... Yeah, of course. So we specifically work with food and batch or batch of process manufacturers in the food and beverage space. Specifically, we''ll work with, let''s say, ops teams to kind of make sure they''re hitting their batch specs, keeping inventory lean, scaling the operation effectively, really prevent production delays with inventory inaccuracies, changes in production schedules, really avoid the stressful audits or failed QA checks. So yeah, that''s kind of what we do. We offer an ERP service to kind of consolidate a lot of that process and really streamline things. Okay, well, we''re a pretty small company. We''ve got 10 employees. We do $4 million a year in sales, and we''ve been doing it for 14 years, and we''ve got it pretty streamlined. Gotcha. And when you say small, because we do work with companies about your size, what does that streamline, what does that process kind of look like for you guys? I know a lot of the companies that we work with, they have a lot of manual data entry. They don''t have a lot of visibility into their business. Maybe they are using Excel or what have you, but there''s a lot of workarounds that they''ve kind of built out through the years. Well, my wife does all the computer stuff, and she''s working with some, I don''t remember the name of her right now, some kind of software that she''s converting over to right now. She''s been doing it for months. So she''s got all that figured out, and it''s the one that her, our CPA is her best friend for like ever. That''s who she suggested. And so, yeah, we''re not going to change anything from that. Okay. Yes. Makes complete sense. Yeah. I don''t think there''s anything you can do for us right now. Perfect. Well, I''m glad you guys got something working for you. Do you mind if I maybe shoot over a little information about what we do? And obviously, if a need arises, I''m happy to be a resource for you guys. Sure. Awesome. Well, I appreciate the time, Josh. I know I called you in the middle of the day out of the blue, so I appreciate you taking the time. All right. Thank you. Of course. Bye-bye. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Our menu options have recently changed. For reception, please press 1. For service and warranty, press... Your call is being transferred. Please hold. TC Electrics, this is Sarah. Hey Sarah, is Randy in by chance? Yeah, one second please. TC Electrics, this is Randy. Hey Randy, it''s Ryan over at ECI. How are you doing today? Hey, I''m good. How are you? I''m good, thanks for asking. I was just following back up. You and I had spoke a few months back briefly about Bolt. We got that project management tool here for people that work with builders, and I just wanted to see if you guys would be open to a 10-minute call maybe next week to take a peek into it. Are you guys still doing quite a bit of new residential construction working with builders? Yeah, and I mean we use ECI for a lot of people. You might be thinking of our builder portal, so that''s for the builders. What we have is a product called Bolt. It takes all of those jobs out of those portals that you''re using for various builders. It puts them into one place, organizes everything. It also handles your crew scheduling, all the change orders. All the POs are just in one place. It also does inventory estimating, so it''s a big project management tool for kind of the whole operation. It might not make sense at first just trying to explain it, but I think once you take a look at it, it might give you an understanding of how it works, and then if you guys wanted to implement it down the road, obviously you could, but I at least wanted to show it to you next week if you had some time. I like the idea of it. I''m just trying to figure out how much of it we would actually end up using. What''s your volume looking like right now? How many homes would you say you''re doing a year, just if you had to guess? I don''t even think I could put a number on it. Over 300, would you say? Yeah. Because we work with about 1,000 crews nationwide, and we help different people with different things. Not everyone uses the inventory features, for example, but a lot of people use their scheduling with us on the app, or some people just want it to be more organized because all the job and field notes and photos, the guys can work off checklists in the field, and all those photos and things can be handy, and just having a place to put all the job folders into one place, and it''s all nice and neat, and I think if you saw it, how the software looks, I think it might kind of resonate with you and could definitely make your day-to-day a lot smoother. But again, not expecting you guys to implement this or purchase it by any means, more so just wanted to see if you wanted to take a look at it. What is the price for this? I''ll be honest. Just paying for the other portal that we use, what''s the difference between this and the regular ECI portal we pay for? I really don''t know. I don''t know how much that builder portal runs. Again, that''s more so for the builders. This is for you guys directly. I more so set up these introductory meetings. My expert, Aaron, it would just be like a 10-minute call next week. He would just give you a high overview of what it does. He''d ask you some questions about your guys'' business, and if it makes sense, cool. If not, then no worries. It''d just be 10, 15 minutes of your time, but he could go over things like pricing, areas that we might be able to help you, and just at least show you what other people are using so you have an understanding of... Because this software was designed specifically for people that work with builders primarily. In fact, it was designed by an electrician out of Texas, so it''s built specifically for what you guys do, and down the road, if you''re looking to scale or just to be organized more overall, this could really be a handy tool. He has some availability, I''m showing, on Tuesday or Wednesday if you wanted to just have a 10, 15-minute chat about it. It would be over the phone? Yeah, so he would give you a call, this same number, or you can take your cell, whatever works best, and he would just kind of ask you some questions about the company. See if, show you how we''ve been able to help others, some of the companies just like you guys that were, you know, able to be more efficient, save on employee costs, and just manage everything from different scheduling features to you name it. But yeah, it would be a 15-minute call, and then if you wanted to see a demo, he would end up scheduling like a demonstration with you. But that first call is just more of an introductory alignment call to make sure it''s even a fit for you, something that makes sense for your company. What time is he available on Tuesday? Tuesday, we could do like 3 p.m. or 2 p.m. We could do 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Okay. And just to clarify, what is a good email address for you? It''s going to be tcadmin at tcelectricco.com. Okay. And what''s the best number for Aaron to give you guys a call at at 2? My direct line is 302-660-9424. 9424. Okay, perfect. I''m going to send you over a calendar invite to your email address here if you could just hit accept for me. And let''s see here. Your central time, you said? Is that right? Are you Eastern? Eastern. Okay, cool. And do you know how many builders that you''re working with right now by chance? Like that use ECI? No, don''t think so much ECI. ECI is just those builder portals. Like I''m sure you''re working with other builders that are using other portals or maybe you just get emails from them. So all your builders in total, it''ll take all of the jobs from all the different portals and put it into one place, not just the ECI one. I know it can be confusing until you see it, but it''s like it''s much more than just working with the ECI ITK builder portals. So as a whole, how many builders would you say that you work with? Oh my gosh. Maybe 20, 30. 20 or 30 builders. Okay. And if you had to guess how many jobs you guys do a year, this just helps us kind of prepare for the meeting. You said over 300? Yeah, definitely over 300. Okay. Maybe 500 or 1,000? Yeah, probably in that ballpark. Okay. And last question for you here. How many crews do you guys have? If we were going to maybe show you some of our scheduling features, how many crews, how many guys do you got in the field? We probably have like 50 or 60 vans that go out a day. 50 or 60 vans. So probably over 100 guys. We usually have like 100 is probably average. Okay, awesome. It might be a little less right now. We''re a little slow right now. Well, cool. We look forward to meeting with you, see if it could be a fit for you guys. And if there''s one thing we can kind of tailor the meeting to, maybe something that''s piqued your interest here on this call, is there anything that comes to mind as far as how Bolt could help you guys maybe streamline your operation? I mean, I''m just like right now we have a ton of different portals that we use for each builder. They all do the same thing, but it''s like catered to each builder. And I''m just, I don''t know. I guess if this Bolt thing can group them together somehow, then that would make it easier. That''s exactly what it does. And it would definitely organize your day-to-day. Are you guys currently using, outside of those builder portals, do you guys use any type of current software to manage your scheduling? Or is it still more so Google calendars? We''re like very old school in a sense still. Like some of our portals we pull payment from, but mainly we just use them for purchase ordering. We take scheduling and put it on our own calendars from whatever the builder is scheduling, but we don''t like do scheduling as far as our crews and where they''re going. Okay. I would love to show you this because I think once you see it, I think it''ll click. That''s typically how it goes. It doesn''t make a lot of sense up front, but once you see how it will align the guides, how it brings all of the jobs into one place, the builder communication is just seamless through the software and just one place for all the jobs. It''ll make more sense on the call. Awesome, Randy. Thank you so much for your time. I have all of this notated. We''re going to give you a call next Tuesday at 2 p.m. is what I have written down. I''m going to send you over that calendar invite and we''ll talk more then. Thank you so much. You have a great day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
This transcript captures a sales call between Ryan from ECI and Randy from TC Electrics. Ryan introduces a project management tool called Bolt, designed for companies working with builders, and schedules a follow-up meeting to provide more details.

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good. How are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions, so I''ll just let you go ahead. Where were you going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. And we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So that''s why I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know? Like when someone uploads, if I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have in the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert Matt for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

Our menu options have recently changed. For reception, please press 1. For service and warranty, press... Your call is being transferred. Please hold. TC Electric, this is Sarah. Hey Sarah, is Randy in by chance? Yeah, one second please. TC Electric, this is Randy. Hey Randy, it''s Ryan over at ECI. How are you doing today? Hey, I''m good. How are you? I''m good, thanks for asking. I was just following back up. You and I had spoke a few months back briefly about Bolt. We got that project management tool here for people that work with builders, and I just wanted to see if you guys would be open to a 10-minute call maybe next week to take a peek into it. Are you guys still doing quite a bit of new residential construction working with builders? Yeah, and I mean we use ECI for a lot of people. You might be thinking of our builder portal, so that''s for the builders. What we have is a product called Bolt. It takes all of those jobs out of those portals that you''re using for various builders. It puts them into one place, organizes everything. It also handles your crew scheduling, all the change orders. All the POs are just in one place. It also does inventory estimating, so it''s a big project management tool for kind of the whole operation. It might not make sense at first just trying to explain it, but I think once you take a look at it, it might give you an understanding of how it works, and then if you guys wanted to implement it down the road, obviously you could, but I at least wanted to show it to you next week if you had some time. I like the idea of it. I''m just trying to figure out how much of it we would actually end up using. What''s your volume looking like right now? How many homes would you say you''re doing a year, just if you had to guess? I don''t even think I could put a number on it. Over 300, would you say? Yeah. Because we work with about 1,000 crews nationwide, and we help different people with different things. Not everyone uses the inventory features, for example, but a lot of people use their scheduling with us on the app, or some people just want it to be more organized because all the job and field notes and photos, the guys can work off checklists in the field, and all those photos and things can be handy, and just having a place to put all the job folders into one place, and it''s all nice and neat, and I think if you saw it, how the software looks, I think it might kind of resonate with you and could definitely make your day-to-day a lot smoother. But again, not expecting you guys to implement this or purchase it by any means, more so just wanted to see if you wanted to take a look at it. What is the price for this? I''ll be honest. Just paying for the other portal that we use, what''s the difference between this and the regular ECI portal we pay for? I really don''t know. I don''t know how much that builder portal runs. Again, that''s more so for the builders. This is for you guys directly. I more so set up these introductory meetings. My expert, Aaron, it would just be like a 10-minute call next week. He would just give you a high overview of what it does. He''d ask you some questions about your guys'' business, and if it makes sense, cool. If not, then no worries. It''d just be 10, 15 minutes of your time, but he could go over things like pricing, areas that we might be able to help you, and just at least show you what other people are using so you have an understanding of... Because this software was designed specifically for people that work with builders primarily. In fact, it was designed by an electrician out of Texas, so it''s built specifically for what you guys do. Down the road, if you''re looking to scale or just to be organized more overall, this could really be a handy tool. He has some availability, I''m showing, on Tuesday or Wednesday if you wanted to just have a 10, 15-minute chat about it. It would be over the phone? Yeah, so he would give you a call, this same number, or you can take your cell, whatever works best, and he would just kind of ask you some questions about the company. See if, show you how we''ve been able to help others, some of the companies just like you guys that were, you know, able to be more efficient, save on employee costs and just manage everything from different scheduling features to you name it. But yeah, it would be a 15 minute call. And then if you wanted to see a demo, he would end up scheduling like a demonstration with you. But that first call is just more of an introductory alignment call to make sure it''s even a fit for you, something that makes sense for your company. What time is he available on Tuesday? Tuesday, we could do like 3 p.m. or a 2 p.m. We could do 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Okay. And just to clarify, what is a good email address for you? It''s going to be tcadmin at tcelectricco.com. Okay. And what''s the best number for Aaron to give you guys a call at at 2? My direct line is 302-660-9424. 9424. Okay, perfect. I''m going to send you over a calendar invite to your email address here if you could just hit accept for me. And let''s see here. Your central time, you said? Is that right? Are you Eastern? Eastern. Okay, cool. And do you know how many builders that you''re working with right now by chance? Like that use ECI? No, don''t think so much ECI. ECI is just those builder portals. Like I''m sure you''re working with other builders that are using other portals or maybe you just get emails from them. So all your builders in total, it''ll take all of the jobs from all the different portals and it''ll put it into one place, not just the ECI one. I know it can be confusing until you see it, but it''s like it''s much more than just working with the ECI ITK builder portals. So as a whole, how many builders would you say that you work with? Oh my gosh. Maybe 20, 30? 20 or 30 builders. Okay. And if you had to guess how many jobs you guys do a year, this just helps us kind of prepare for the meeting. You said over 300? Yeah, definitely over 300. Okay. Maybe 500 or 1,000? Yeah, probably in that ballpark. Okay. And last question for you here. How many crews do you guys have? If we were going to maybe show you some of our scheduling features, how many crews, how many guys do you got in the field? We probably have like 50 or 60 vans that go out a day. 50 or 60 vans. So probably over 100 guys. We usually have like 100 is probably average. Okay, awesome. It might be a little less right now. We''re a little slow right now. Well, cool. We look forward to meeting with you, see if it could be a fit for you guys. And if there''s one thing we can kind of tailor the meeting to, maybe something that''s piqued your interest here on this call, is there anything that comes to mind as far as how Bolt could help you guys maybe streamline your operation? I mean, I''m just like right now we have a ton of different portals that we use for each builder. They all do the same thing, but it''s like catered to each builder. And I''m just, I don''t know. I guess if this Bolt thing can group them together somehow, then that would make it easier. That''s exactly what it does. Yeah, it would definitely organize your day-to-day. Are you guys currently using, outside of those builder portals, do you guys use any type of current software to manage your scheduling? Or is it still more so Google calendars? We''re like very old school in a sense still. Like some of our portals we pull payment from, but mainly we just use them for purchase ordering. We take scheduling and put it on our own calendars from whatever the builder is scheduling, but we don''t like do scheduling as far as our crews and where they''re going. Okay. I would love to show you this because I think once you see it, I think it''ll click. That''s typically how it goes. It doesn''t make a lot of sense up front, but once you see how it will align the guides, how it brings all of the jobs into one place, the builder communication is just seamless through the software and just one place for all the jobs. It''ll make more sense on the call. Awesome, Randy. Thank you so much for your time. I have all of this notated. We''re going to give you a call next Tuesday at 2 p.m. is what I have written down. I''m going to send you over that calendar invite and we''ll talk more then. Thank you so much. You have a great day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Are you guys currently using, outside of those builder portals, do you guys use any type of current software to manage your scheduling? Or is it still more so Google Calendars? We''re like very old school in a sense still. Like some of our portals we pull payment from, but mainly we just use them for purchase ordering. We take scheduling and put it on our own calendars from whatever the builder is scheduling, but we don''t like do scheduling as far as our crews and where they''re going. Okay. I would love to show you this because I think once you see it, I think it''ll click. That''s typically how it goes. It doesn''t make a lot of sense up front, but once you see how it will align the guys, how it brings all of the jobs into one place, the builder communication is just seamless through the software and just one place for all the jobs. It''ll make more sense on the call. Awesome, Randy. Thank you so much for your time. I have all of this notated. We''re going to give you a call next Tuesday at 2 p.m. is what I have written down. I''m going to send you over that calendar invite and we''ll talk more then. Thank you so much. You have a great day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
This transcript captures a sales call between Ryan from ECI and Randy from TC Electric.

How are you, Chrissy? Good. How''s everybody doing over there? Good for Friday. Good for Friday. Yeah. Yeah, TGIF. It''s been a week. January was its own year, I''m pretty sure. So you guys, I''m sorry, are you guys in St. Louis or Jeff City? St. Louis. Yeah, I was actually in Jeff City most of the week, but back in the office today. There you go. Yeah. Hey, Robert. Good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon. Jeff, I''ll let you tell us when you''re ready. I know there''s several people invited, but I''ll just let you let us know when you''re ready to kick it off. Okay. I''m not sure who all is available on our end. Robert, thanks for hopping on. I think Andrew''s in another meeting, and I''m not sure about David, so it might just be us. Yeah, just know that we''re using Fathom. We''re recording it so we can share the recording at the end for people that can''t join, but they can watch at their leisure. So, well, thanks for joining. We''ve had several calls with Jeff and a few other team members about this new product that we call Evolution X. You guys have been going down this path a little bit, trying to work with a vendor to build out an e-commerce solution, but in finding out we have one already that''s fully vetted, everything that you''re looking to have in the solution, I think we have for you guys. So we wanted to get in front of a bigger group today just to show you. CJ''s on the phone. CJ comes from Evolution X. I''m your account manager from the Automate Sandpoint. I''m from Jeff City, Missouri. I''ve been doing this 39 years, so happy to work with you guys. I know Bruce really well. But anyway, CJ''s going to kind of go over the product in a little high level. Please ask questions. This is for you guys just to make sure you''re comfortable with the decision going forward. So with that, I''m going to turn it over to you, CJ. Yeah, so Chrissy, Rob, I know we''ve met with Jeff and the team fairly extensively last year, and there''s a lot that I think we''ll look to hit on high level in the demo. But would it be helpful before we got in the demo if we gave you any background context on Evolution X, like who we are, how we work, any of that type of stuff? Or do you feel pretty good about it? I''m pretty familiar, but maybe for Robert''s sake, just give us a quick overview. Yeah, sure. Just the cliff notes. I''ll give you 30,000 foot. If you''re part of ECI, you can''t be too terrible, right? Yeah, 30,000 foot view. So Evolution X e-commerce is a B2B e-commerce software that''s been around about 17 years. And so we got acquired by ECI two years ago, and it was just because they had enough customers in the office supply space that were beginning to buy us and request that ECI build an integration. It just made sense for them to buy us. And so now that has transitioned into the field service and the automates division and customer base. And so we''ve had several customers, I don''t know, throughout the last six months beginning to onboard, and it''s been a lot of fun. So just think of this as a robust B2B e-commerce software that would compete with any big box player out there. But we''re bringing it to the small, medium-sized distributor within the ECI family. Awesome. Cool. I''ll share my screen and we can jump into this. So this demo is for you guys. Stop me anywhere. We can pivot. I''m definitely going to be asking you guys questions just to see how you would use certain aspects of the platform. But this is the flow that I''m going to go through. I''ll show you some finished customer examples so you can get an idea of what this would look like. We''ll give you a back-end overview, and I''ll make a change on the homepage of my website so you can see what would this look like for Jeff to be able to manage. Some search functionality. Once we build the website and get your catalogs and items loaded, you''ll be able to do a lot of cool stuff with boosting certain brands or products in the search results. Some marketing tools, and then I will log in as a customer at the end so you can get a feel for what that''s going to look like for your customers. Okay. So I pulled a few customer examples here. He''s not. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, I misunderstood. I pulled a few customer examples here. We designed these in-house for you guys. So the way this would work, if you decide to go with Evolution X, our design team consults with you, and if you want us to do 20 pages of custom design or you want us to do no custom design, we can go a few different routes, and I''ve pulled examples of each. This is a fully custom homepage for a dealer that''s in the office supply space. They also sell some technology and other products as well. But I think from a design perspective, we can make this look any way you want it to look. Some people have a vision for what this dropdown might look like when someone shops for office supplies and having this big category menu pop up on the side. A lot of different ways we can look to go about this, but I think the main concept is if somebody''s looking for any printers and technology, any category of products, they should be able to click a button and pretty quickly get to the category of products that they''re looking for. So in this instance, we''ll just go to printers. If you wanted to take them down certain decision trees, we can have as many or as few of these as you want. But again, ideally these customers are going to be able to find the products they''re looking for pretty quickly on your website. What if they have a SKU and know exactly the product that they''re looking for? Yeah, I''m guessing that manufacturer reference is searchable. 100%. So that''s where some of the search capability will come into play, where if you want them to be able to search by the product number, reference number, that can be done any way you guys want. We''ll have full flexibility over the search bar. Okay, so it can even index the description for, I put in Dell 14-inch 256 gig, it''s going to go, hey, here''s five results that have those words in the description. Yeah, it would pull up from the description, the category, the attributes, whatever fields we need to pull it from. Absolutely. So I''ll look to show you a few different ways we could leverage the search bar, but that''s certainly one of them. Now, looking at less custom design, this website is one of our out-of-the-box themes. So at a base level, we have some templates or themes, we call them, that we can spin up, and essentially we would put your color scheme, your branding, your logo. We would put media in here from you guys, or we can supply it. But at a base level, this is what a basic website could look like. If you want to have a shop by brand, a banner running across the site. So anyway, just giving you an idea for what this could look like. I''ll pull up one more that I think has a unique design. CJ, just a quick question, going back to the searching functionality. One of the hurdles that we have right now is that if you put in like 14-inch laptop, for example, it doesn''t pull everything because the solution we''re using only references the short description. Did I hear you say that EvoX actually can access a number of different fields to return search results? Yeah, absolutely. Keywords, attributes. So you can go back on any given product, and there''s a field where you can say, we call it keywords, but if you type in a keyword and associate it with that product, it means that line of products will pop up whenever that keyword is associated with the product. There''s like several different ways we could go about it. And this, I think, is important to note. I say that we''re a white glove service, but your arm-in-arm is probably the more accurate way to say it. You''re going to have a really good customer success team helping you build this website. A lot of this is we''re going to train you on all the aspects of how to do this so that we''re not a bottleneck. Like if you want to go do these things on your own in the future, we don''t want to stand in your way. But if you do want help with these things, you''ll have live chat support from us. You''ll have resources that can jump on a call and help you solve a problem like that if it came up and you were having trouble getting one product to pull up in search the way you want. But ideally, we''re going to help load your catalogs and help organize them the way that you want it before the site goes live. That way the search is functioning correctly the way you want it before we launch and start getting customers on the website. Awesome. Just a totally different design is the only reason I pulled this up. They wanted something where you could hover over a category and these little submenus would pop up. So just giving you a feel for possibilities. I think we can design anything you guys would want. But this will be something to think about, Jeff and all of you, as we go down this road. If you do want Customization, we''ll want to set up a meeting with our design team. That way they can make recommendations and hear what you''re looking for, and we can properly scope you on the design aspect of it. Now, something way less glamorous is my demo store. I designed this, so don''t judge me. And I wouldn''t be the one designing your website, but I''ll use this just to navigate, move some stuff around, and go through the demo. Let me see. I''m actually going to log out of my user, and I''ll log back into him in a second. Back into the website. So when you guys log in, this is what it''s going to look like from an admin perspective. You''ll have access to some basic KPI and data reports. It''s surface level. There''s more analytics in other areas of the platform that I''ll show you, but at surface level, you''ll see order conversions, how much revenue is coming through the store on a monthly, weekly basis. You can drag and drop and move any of this around. Chat support, again, we do chat support US and UK hours, so it''s not quite 24-7, but it''s close. And these are actual solutions experts, not middle people between you and the person that can solve the problem. So if you have an issue, you can chat our team. I''ve never had anyone take longer than five minutes to reply to me, and they can grab your screen, send you articles, jump on a call. This side menu is where you will navigate all the aspects of the platform. If you see a new button somewhere, this is a new feature we''ve added. We add features monthly. We don''t charge you guys anything extra for that. And I''ll show you this one because it''s pretty cool. So most dealers would have us, I''ll filter this out to the last 30 days. They used to have us integrate Google Analytics to the platform, and we can still do that if you want, but it can be overkill for a lot of people. So we just took the main components of Google Analytics and baked it into EvolutionX. So you can come in here and see how many people on your site are a user with a login versus a guest. What are the page views over time? What are the top pages people are looking at? Who''s the top users? You can just get a lot of granular data about your business and the website, how it''s trending. And I''ll show you some ways this could become relevant. Search results. So this will be, again, giving you data on when people come to your site, what keywords are they actually typing into the search bar. You might have something that is in your top 10 that''s unexpected. Well, when someone types that in, you''re going to want to make sure that the right products are popping up, as we discussed. So I''ll stop there. What questions do you have about any of this or anything we''ve shown to this point? Are you able to slice those? Sorry. Yeah, I was going to say, are you able to slice those analytics down to like a from like a seven day down to a one day or out to a 30 day? Yep. Up here. Yeah. And you can make it a custom range if you if you want. Awesome. So that''s good. What else, Jeff? Did you have a question? Yeah. From the design perspective, I''m curious of your approach is from our perspective, do we create like a wire frame and give that to you guys so you kind of know what to go from? Or is it more of a collaborative meet with us a couple of times? Your designers put together some options and then we, you know, go through the approval process and editing process. Yeah, it can go either way. I don''t think it hurts to have a wire frame, but you don''t need one. And our team is definitely not accustomed to having one. So see if you already have something drafted up and you want to bring it, then certainly that helps. But most people don''t. Our team is there to kind of show different examples and just take cues from you. And then we do go through an iterative process. So we''ll make a draft based off of what we think you want from that initial meeting. And then we might have to revise it three or four times. OK. So that would be standard practice. But what I''ll show you next that Jeff has seen is once we build you this site, you''re going to have a lot of ability to customize it or make changes. And so I''ll show you what that looks like right now. I use this jump to button in the top left just because it''s quicker to get around. I''m going to type in layouts. So after the site is built, this is where you''ll see all the different page layouts that come with the website. I''m going to go into the home page. So you can do code in HTML if you want to on this platform, but you don''t have to. Most of this is meant to be drag and drop, no code. And so we house all of the media media content in these tiles that we call widgets. For example, I have a media gallery tile. If I open it up, I have an image of this office room. If I go to, let me log out of this user. If I go to the homepage of my website and scroll down, that image is right here on my website. So I just uploaded this from my desktop into this widget. I don''t need to know code. Now, if I did want to take it and say resize it, or I wanted to switch it to the other side of the website, you can kind of see all these boxes moving around in a very drag and drop format. So this is kind of the general concept of moving stuff around, what it looks like, all that good stuff. Now, what I am going to do, on my website, I have some items for sale. We call this an item merchandiser, and it says new products. Maybe it''s the end of the month, you''ve got a sale going on, and you want to highlight that and make it the first thing people see when they go to your website. I would come into this item merchandising widget and open it up. I''ll change the title to end of month specials. If you want different living, breathing list of product groups in here, you can have them. If you want to change how fast the carousel is running, you can make it two seconds versus three seconds. But I''ll just save my changes, and I''ll take this up to the top of my website. Resize it, save and publish. Cool. Now, if I go back to my website and hit refresh, that''s going to be a real-time change. So now you''ll see the end of month specials carousel hitting my website. And I could probably do that in less than a minute if I wasn''t talking. So Jeff, would that mainly be you or would... Yeah, most likely I''ll be the one administering the site. Perfect. So any questions about what it looks like to make a look and feel change or just any design-oriented stuff from that perspective from the rest of the team? No. A lot of flexibility and options. Yeah. CJ, one of the things that I do recall from a previous demo was how you showcased how we could feature specific brands or specific products. So for example, right now we''re kind of doing a special on Dynabook, right? So for the recording, for the folks that couldn''t be with us, would you mind just talking about how we can highlight certain brands or certain products and then run specials on those products? And then I remember even saying you could connect the product listing to like a blog article on such a product. So would you mind just explaining to the team, please? Absolutely. So a few different ways you can leverage the search results from maximizing brands or categories of products. The first point being if you wanted them to search a part number, SKU, reference number, you could do it that way. Another example, my demo store is set up to where if I type in copy paper, and I know this is an office supplies example, but you''ll get the point. I type in copy paper, I have my Evolution X copy paper showing up first. This is ambitious margins I''m shooting for, $350, but you get the point. I''ve got a banner displaying that, hey, 45% off, right? And so that''s the general idea. Now, the way we set this up is pretty straightforward. On the back end, there''s a feature called brand priority. Again, our team will help you guys set this up before the site goes live, so you won''t be alone in figuring this out. But all I do is come in here and choose the brand that I''m looking to influence. I''ll just do 3M. And I could say I want 3M to be number one or number 10. Maybe you hate them and you want to bury them in the search results. We''ll say we want them to be number one, and then you would just open up what catalog we''re pulling from. I think it''s important to know we have a good amount of catalogs built into Evolution X. So if you''re an approved vendor with a distributor network or a TD Cinex or Ingram, we can spin those up, and then you would just go select the catalog, and I''ll say technology, warranties. I want 3M to be the number one brand that pops up for this category. And so that''s one way you can influence brands. It''s pretty straightforward. Another would be Let''s just see if I type in coffee maker, I have a media banner displaying above products. So yes, I typed in coffee maker, it''s pulling up all the coffee makers, but I have a bun coffee banner displaying above the products. So if somebody clicked that, it would take me directly to those products. There''s another way you can go about influencing the search results or the customer journey as well. You could get, I want to see if I have this set up, let me see stapler. I was going to say maybe staplers. I''ve seen some people do it where maybe it''s not a brand, but it''s a category. Like if I typed in staplers, maybe it pulls up desktop staplers instead of, I don''t know, like a heavy duty stapler. So it may not be a brand, maybe it''s a category you want showing up first. But Jeff, to your point, what we see people doing more and more is called guided selling. And so I think in your industry, we see this being valuable just from educating the customer on how to buy your products. So this is a furniture example, but you''ll get the point of how this could relate to what you''re wanting to do. If I''m on this customer''s website, Codex, and I''m looking for desk options, I can get to the products, but it also has this blog above the products that will educate me on how to select the best office desk, how to make sure it''s the correct height, how to choose the right size. And to Jeff''s point, you''ll notice that throughout this blog, links to cross-sell items that would be compatible with an office desk. So you can go big or small with this type of concept, but essentially guiding the customer towards purchasing a certain product. And then when I click office desks, it''s giving me the same type of experience, but eventually I can actually get to the product that I''m looking for. What questions do y''all have looking at that? So I love that for the new customers, the people that are new and fresh to the site. Honestly, though, also we will have customers where there''s an expectation of consistent repeat business. One of the customers, for example, that we''re trying to set this up for does have an e-commerce spend on technology hardware in the seven-figure range. So for them, we want to make it a very convenient user experience. Can we talk just a little bit about how we could set up favorites and reorders and kind of making that convenient for quick purchases for people that are kind of reordering the same things? Or bundles and if they can be on a per customer. Absolutely. So what I''m about to show you, you guys will be able to do. On the back end, I''m going to go pull up some made up accounts that I have. So theoretically, this would be the accounts that are on here. If you want certain people in your company to only have access to certain accounts, that''s very doable. But I have CJ''s Furniture Co. as a made up account. Before I log in, just to show you, you''ll have some data at the organization level and at the user level as far as their recent order history. You can track their spin, the trajectory of that, their search history, the top users, all of that stuff. But I''ll go log as a user here. So I have myself made up as an account and I''m going to go log in on my profile. So if a sales rep of yours wanted to do what I''m showing you right now, you could do that. You can target promotions to people specifically. Just to take a step back, I have myself labeled as a school supplies customer. So this is a simple way a label could be leveraged where I''m getting hit with a promotion based on how I''m labeled on the back end. The homepage of your website could look totally different as well. But when your customers log in, this is the portal experience that they''re going to have on your website. There''s a few touches that you don''t have to do, but you can put their logo. When they log in, instead of your logo, theirs is going to show up at the top of the website. Obviously, their user profile, you can put their headshot. They''ll have access to some basic stuff at surface levels to recent order history. They could quickly just click view, get into a recent order, print it, email it, or just click reorder all. And all those items will be added to the cart. So that''s one way. they could do a quick reorder. If they have multiple saved carts, they''ll be able to view that, multiple credit cards. If two scenarios, if they have a budget assigned to them by their boss, this is where they can come in and check the status of their budget, the balance remaining. Maybe they have to submit orders and get them approved. They can check the status of those orders. Or if they''re the person that has to approve the orders, those would all filter in the orders to approve field. But they''ll have access to some surface level stuff here. And then when they click their name, this side menu is going to come up. If you want to do rewards points, you can do stuff like that, like a traditional e-commerce type of feature. But a quick list would be what I think you call like a favorites list. So if I was a sales rep, I could go in and build these for my customers or the customer could do it themselves. But ideally, if every time I have to restock the copy room, I buy the same things, I would just put those items on a quick list. The quantities could be preset or a customer can just check a box and say add those items to the cart. These can be set up on recurring order. If they buy the same things on the same days of every month, no challenges with any of that. And all of those items I added obviously are showing up in the checkout cart where I can then go through the order process. CJ, quick question. Going back to the approver relationship, is it possible to create a workflow within the site that sends an automated email to the approver when one of his employees submits an order? Yeah, absolutely. So this is where you will have to give different people within their organization different levels of access. So let''s just say, for example, I''m a CFO and you made me a super admin user. They could set this up or again, you can set it up for them, but they will be able to come in here and set whatever approval controls they want. And so under advanced settings or approval settings, and I don''t know why this is taking a minute to load. Oh, there we go. So this is where they would come in and set their, there''s a few different things I''ll show you here, but they''ll come and set whatever approval workflows they want. And then this trigger the email to your point. So if they wanted to track by cost center, so maybe they want to track spin by department. If they wanted to create budgets for specific users, they could come in and do that here. And if they wanted to set it where maybe all orders acquire approval or CJ is allowed to spend $500 a month, anything above that''s going to acquire approval, they would save those settings. Then what we do on the back end, we have email templates that can be customized and we would just associate that template with that account for that event. So if they have an approval email and they want to get notified when that happens, we would just tie an email template to that workflow. So does that answer the question? Yep, it does. And in case you guys hear the alarms, we''re just doing our testing today. So it''s not like we''re code red or anything. Okay, I actually hadn''t heard it at all until you just said that. I caught just a glimpse of it, but we really can''t hear it. Okay. Yeah, we can hear it on our side pretty well. Yeah, I was going to say it''s probably inconvenient for you. I thought it was the ice cream truck. That''d be nice. So you''re doing a good job of guiding me, Jeff. These are all the things I normally would show, but I want to keep this relevant to you. So what other things have we not hit on that you guys have questions about or want to see? So we have the capability to take credit cards through, I guess, the Stripe platform. And then we also have the option on here to accept or for people to pay using their terms that they have with us. Is that right? It is. I''m assuming, Craig, are y''all using NetOne? I don''t know. We''re currently using Stripe to accept credit card payments. But I think to further Chrissy''s question, we''re interested in understanding a little bit more about the integration with eAutomate from kind of an accounting perspective. Got it. So the short answer is yes. We can, like, I''ll show you the app store. You can certainly use Stripe. My store is actually set up with Stripe. But this is all the third-party apps that we have pre-existing integrations built with. So MailChimp for email marketing services, HubSpot as a CRM. There''s a good amount of stuff in here. But ideally, I know Craig can probably answer your questions about NetOne on a separate call. But if you wanted customers to obviously use NetOne or pay down using ACH, those are things that can be done as well. But Stripe, very doable. Chris, yeah, I''ll have some I get with you, Christy, on the NetOne side because the majority of our clients do use NetOne and interfaces with the Automate integrates, I mean, and also your customer info if you''re using that. So to me, it''s a no-brain must-have type solution. It costs you nothing to get in. We just do a couple of reviews of what you''re currently paying rate-wise and get you what those percentages would be. But yeah, let me get you in touch with them, guys. Okay. Great. Thank you. So what I''m showing you is fake test data. So it''s not 100% what it would look like. This is a different ERP. But just on the customer portal and when we do integrate this to eAutomate, there will be an invoice history tab. And this is where they would come in and view their invoice history. Typically, these fields are clickable when it is actual orders that are pulling from an ERP. So if they wanted to actually hyperlink and click into that, they could see it. But it will pull the invoice history for on and offline orders. So even if a customer doesn''t buy a product online, we''re still going to pull that invoice history for them to do 24-7. So that''ll be a critical aspect of the integration that I forgot to cover when we were in the back-end portal. Okay. I''m confused. I actually have two questions, CJ, one of which is actually just a peripheral thing that I''ve forgotten about. Do customers, shoppers, have the ability to link out of their shopping cart to go back to the product listing? Yeah. So we''ll show that. Chrissy, you said you''re confused? Yeah. Can you just recap this page that you''re on again? Yep. You lost me. It''s okay. No, that''s perfect. So EvolutionX integrates with 30 different ERP systems. Oh, okay. So eAutomate is one. We work with a number of different. So the only context behind that is my demo store is not integrated to eAutomate for that reason. So I have a demo store that has some fake data to where I can just show you that when your customers are logged in, they will have an invoice history tab. So this is where they would open that up and they would have access to all of their invoice history on your website. Okay. I get it. The data doesn''t look exactly the same as what the eAutomate data will look like because this is fake data. Just to give you an idea of what it would look like, they''ll be able to hyperlink and click and open these orders up. But anyway, we''re going to feed all orders. Yeah, they''ll be able to go through an order history. And the reason that''s relevant is maybe, again, like maybe they don''t buy online from you, but you can still access their invoice history without having to call you, right? So it''s going to pull all orders on and offline. Nice. That''s awesome. CJ, I heard you say... Now, your question, I''ll show you. Sorry. I''m just going to circle back to that one. So I''ve got items in the cart here. Let me just go to the cart. So this is where, again, like if I was in the cart and I wanted to click into an item, I could just open it up. Sorry, what were you about to ask? What was I going to ask? Sorry. Oh, yeah. No, it''s all good. I heard you say it integrates with 30 other apps, and I heard MailChimp in there as well. Just curious about the integration of things like ConnectWise or Salesforce or Kaseya or other platforms of that nature. Do you guys integrate with those as well? So I don''t know that we have integrations with any of those existing right now. Here''s what this looks like. EvolutionX is open API, so technically we can integrate with any third-party app. If we don''t have an existing integration, it may take some dev work. So there may just be a cost associated with that. And Salesforce would be a big one. Like we could integrate Salesforce, and we''ve had a number of customers that are starting to ask us for it. business case there, but the Salesforce is also very different for every company. The way we use Salesforce at ECI might be very different than you guys. And so it just takes a little bit of, the answer is yes, but there would be a dev cost associated with it. And I couldn''t even tell you what that is. Those kind of are done case by case. Okay. But the capability is there. Yeah, we can do it. So the platform is built to integrate. Okay. And so for guest users, we can hide published pricing or make it so they have to be a registered user before they can browse the catalog? A thousand percent. You can customize this. Okay. Yep. Based off of what their role is, and it''s all checkboxes for the most part. Like if you just want to take away certain permissions like pricing, you would just uncheck a box. What about like margin and markup rules? I''m assuming we can do that per company, per customer. Can we do it? Like how complicated can we get with the rules? Like can we say, hey, do 20% unless that puts it over MSRP, things like that? That''s typically data we pull from eAutomate. So if you''re talking just to the basic level, right, like you could call it contract pricing. Every different user logs in and sees a different set of pricing for the same product. That''s all data that we pull real time from eAutomate. Now you could do it in EvolutionX as well. Just in order, some ERPs are different in terms of maybe if you run a discount on the website, it has to match something you have in the ERP too for it to like push over correctly. But the answer is yes. I don''t know if I''m making sense on that explanation. I''m not an eAutomate user, so I wouldn''t know if you were making sense or not. It may be something we have to do a follow-up with the team that does the care and feeding of eAutomate on our side. At a basic level, the concept of somebody logging in and seeing a certain promotion or seeing certain pricing, 100%. That is, I would say, a table stakes feature of EvolutionX. What other questions do you guys have? I can show you the blog feature. If you mentioned that, the AI blog. I don''t know, Jeff, that might just be your thing. I want to see it. It is. I''ll probably be supporting it a little bit, but I think it''s exciting for the other people on the call to just see how we can truly reinforce the buying decision with some marketing content. Yeah. Two things I''ll show you. Something that is built and something that is being built that will go live this summer, and both are pretty cool. I feel like I do a pretty good job of looking at the other e-commerce products in the market, and I do think we''re doing the most with AI. This is the first thing we did about a year ago where... Give me a blog title, anybody. Benefits of what? What''s a break-by? Benefits of Wi-Fi 6. Go for it. Go for it, Robert. Benefits of Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi 6, like this? Yep. Cool. Okay, I''ll type in the title. You can make the tone professional, casual, funny. We''ll do funny. You can adjust the word length, ASCII, VOX, AI, and it''s going to start to spit out your blog for you. Now, you''re going to want to proofread it, but the results, it does spit out a pretty remarkable. Ideally, it''s trying to take away 70% of the lead time of writing a blog. Now, once you have edited and make sure that that looks the way you want it to look, it will do the excerpt for you. It will do the meta information for search engine optimization. And kind of like you saw on the customer example where it was educating the buyer on how to buy office furniture, if you wanted to link products into the blog, this is just where you would come in. I''m just going to type in random numbers. You would type in the SKU, part number, the name, whatever, and you can add products that could be linked back into the blog. So that''s just one example. ChatGPT is baked in here too, so if you needed ideas for a blog title, you could type that in and have it give you ideas. So that''s current state, but I will show you, I think I have some slides here in this deck. Yes, here we go. So we are adding co-pilot to the platform, and we have some customers in beta testing right now, but this will be a full AI assistant that will give you data, but it''ll go do tasks for you as well. And Jeff, I don''t even know if we''ve talked about this because it''s pretty new, but in this example, it was asking what are the best sellers this month. It pulled that data. You tell it to create a 10% discount code for those items and name it best sellers of the month. So it will go do that for you. And then you say, can you, essentially, can you make a marketing page based off of these best sellers? Don''t show quantities or prices. It will go build a marketing page for you that you can go essentially copy and paste and make your own content page on the website. That''s insane. That''s awesome. Yeah. So I''ve got a few examples in this slide deck, but I think you get the point. Like any business data you want to pull, gross revenue, or if you want it to extend contracts as an example, this will be able to do a lot of cool stuff for you guys. And that, again, we''re shooting for summertime to have that live, but this is the direction it''s going. So lots of cool stuff with AI. Yeah. Another question that is probably important to talk about is deal registration. Are you guys familiar with deal registration and how we might deal with that from the perspective of hardware? I''m not. Craig might be. Yeah, fill me in. Robert, do you have a more technical explanation possibly? Sure. So a lot of manufacturers that do not sell directly to customers, they want to be able to forecast it. And so they will do partner-initiated deal registrations that get you better pricing. Those terms are typically good anywhere from 60 to 180 days. And once we have that by saying, hey, customer ABC is going to buy 100 Dell laptops over the next six months, they go, cool, that''s awesome. Your new price for them is this. Okay. And ideally, it''s a better margin for you. Am I hearing that right? Oh, yeah. Okay, cool. And so what''s your thought on, like, what are you wanting to do with that information on the e-commerce platform? Well, I mean, we pass some of the savings along, but they can see then better pricing instead of us having to go in and manually do an override every time. There''s not much in the IT marketplace that''s going to ever just be commodity of this is the price and here''s your pre-negotiated markup. You''re always going to end up with these deal reges and big deal pricing type stuff. Got it. So I''m going to show you, I don''t know if this is hitting on what you''re wanting. So it''s not just the pricing, but you''re wanting them to see that they''re getting a better price on it within a certain timeframe? I believe so. Yeah. Like if we could have something like your price, which is good through, you know, March 31st or something like that. Okay. So two thoughts on this, and I''m kind of thinking about this on the fly. Let me do. So the first thing you could do is make a promotion in the platform and display that to the customer. So as an example, I could say 10% off February. And again, like this is a generic title, but this could be a product line, right? So you would set the start and the stop dates for the promotion. So if you know that it''s going to fall within certain dates, you could come in here and filter where the system is going to automatically cut that off on a certain day for the customer. And then you would select the promotion type. So in this case, maybe they''re getting a dollar amount off or a percentage off, which would be, hey, within these dates, you''ve got a 10% discount. It''s going to generate a coupon code. Then you just set some limits where maybe they can only use the code one time and maybe only five people on the account can use it. Maybe they have to spend $300 to qualify. None of this might be relevant to your example, but you can set rules and conditions. And then whatever promotion you''re running, you would just apply it across a group of products. Can you apply that to a specific customer though? Because these are customer specific. Yes. And I''m assuming you can do it without the coupon to where they just see the better pricing and know it''s big deal pricing or whatever. Yep. When they log in, you might have to display a... So a few ways you could approach that, right? Like, yes, when they go in, there could be a notification on their portal. When you set this promotion, it could send them an email or as another layer, what you might need to do. And this, it''s a little bit of manual work, but this is honestly kind of just e-commerce. Let me just go badges. You would create a product badge that would display whatever text you''re wanting it to say above the product so they know that they''re getting a 10% off within this timeframe. Are those customizable? Yeah, so essentially you just type in the text that you want the badge to say, and then if you want to have a different hover text, and then the text color is just a hex code you can just select. Cool. So in the badge association, you can do on contract, so it can be for different customers, different users, however you want to go about that. So the application of some of these things that would be specific to a customer''s account or portal within the site would be for us having, what am I trying to say? So we''ll have the capability, say, to go into customer ABC and put specific badges on or make sure their pricing is in line with whatever deal registration we have with them. 100%. You''ll be able to log in. If you wanted to check out for a customer, you could, like if a sales rep had to place an order or send a customer a quote, you can build quotes on the back end. But the answer to your question is yes, you could do all of that or see all of that information on the customer profile. Awesome. Okay, cool. What about, so a customer purchases something, what are the rules of, hey, maybe we shouldn''t automatically order this. This hit a dollar amount threshold or these are our top ones that customers screw up their order on and then want to return or whatever logic, what rules can you have on that to require manual intervention instead of just going, yep, got an order, place it. Yeah, so Craig, I wish we had Jamie here. We have a technical guy on the eAutomate side that could tell you what buttons we press to pause it better than I could, but I know that we do it with every ERP. So it could be certain orders or items or certain customers even, like maybe some customers you don''t want them to be able to check out and you want them to have to approve everything. That can all be customized. Some of it is dependent on the ERP though, like there''s some work that can be ERP specific. Sure, I mean. Technically how they set it up, but yes, we do that all the time. Well, and I imagine for, you know, we go live with this the first month or so, we probably are pausing literally every order just to make sure we''ve got all the kinks worked out just to lay eyes on. We do a lot of testing with you guys. We''ll do a ton of test orders. You can give us a scenario that would concern you and we run through it, right? And so it''s kind of like, that''s one layer. And then like in all likelihood, all of your customers aren''t going to be using this day one either. You might, typically people migrate them on in batches. Yeah, just so it''s digestible for you guys and you can get a feel for like, what does this look like? And it''s a customer you trust. And so, yeah. And Jeff will attest, I''m very good at breaking websites. Hey, they''re easy to break, man. It''s not a, yeah, it''s not difficult to do. I''ll tell you guys, I''ve been doing this 39 years and we''ve rolled out a lot of products and I am very proud of what CJ and the team has done. This product is amazing. And the integration we built into eAutomate only enhances it. So we''re excited about it. I''ve not heard him yet say we can''t do this. So they''ve built a lot of functionality into the solution and it''s exciting to get it in front of you guys for sure. Awesome. CJ, let''s talk just a little bit about support if we could, please. One of the challenges that we''re currently experiencing is I more or less have two people that I can reach out to with technical questions on our current solution. A lot of times, we''re not getting prompt responses. Could you just talk to us a little bit about the support team and what that looks like and how we can make sure that we have the resources we need to make the solution successful? Yep. So two years during implementation, you''re going to get assigned a technical person and more of a customer success person. So these two people are directly responsible for your project as a whole and they kind of serve as your ongoing point of contact after the site goes live. They built it with you. They know you. So that''s an actual person, right, that you can reach out to. But the better way to do it on an ongoing basis is to use Intercom. We''re the only product within ECI that uses this. We fought hard to keep it. It''s been a big reason that we win business and keep business. And so again, like you have our solutions experts live on here. These aren''t people that are gonna, like you have a problem, they''re not gonna say, yeah, let me get ahold of someone. They can solve the problem. Like those are the actual developers and solutions experts. And so if you put something in the chat that need help, like I said, I''ve never had a reply in over five minutes and they can grab your screen. They can jump on a call. They can send you articles. They''re really, really, really good. So. So they will jump on a call? Oh yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And do you guys have SLAs in place for that? Or is that like, like you said, five minutes is the longest you''ve waited. So if you go in here, this, and this is really just to cover our base. It says we typically reply in under 20 minutes. There''s not a concrete SLA to answer your question. This is just me giving you a look and feel. But what I can do, like I''ll just put something vague in the chat right now. And as we''re talking, we can just see how long it takes them. I don''t know. We''ll just plug it in and see what happens. But no, like to answer your question. Well, I can''t see that far. Did you tell them you''re doing a demo and you have to respond right away? Typically I didn''t tell them. If I tell them I''m on a demo, they will be like super quick. And so I did it on purpose. Because I do, I mean, like I am not, I have gotten to be a website guy as a byproduct of having worked with this product for a couple of years, but I''m not a website person. Like I''ve never been a web developer. So these stores, I build them out myself and I have trouble all the time or I run into stuff and I have to use this myself. And so it''s quicker to get ahold of the team on this thing than it is sending them a Teams chat, like on Microsoft Teams. And so I use it all the time. And again, I''d say five minutes is pretty custom. Sometimes it''s faster, but I''ve never had them not reply to me in five minutes. So how many people- They''re probably helping real customers instead. Say that again. They''re probably helping real customers instead. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. If they see something from me pop up, they''re probably annoyed, but that''s okay. They''re like, CJ, you should know that. No, but they, so we have a knowledge base. So sometimes what they''ll do, if it''s an answer that''s like, let me see, I might have to go to a different, I might have to go to my Edge browser to pull this up. If they, if it''s an answer that''s like in our knowledge base that you guys have access to, they might ping you an article real quick and say, hey, check paragraph five or something like that at a lease case. But you''ll have access to this as well. So it''s just another layer of like self-service. If there''s something that you have a question about, you can use the search bar or find our knowledge base and all of our educational materials too. Cool. How many people- Oh yeah, I was just curious how big that support team is that manages that intercom. Yeah, it''s about 30 of them. It looks like there''s three that are on right now. Got it. And there might be more. I normally can only see three, but we have 30. And again, keep in mind, there''s a team in the UK, or sorry, in the US, and then a bulk of them are in the UK as well. Yeah, you mentioned that earlier. So close to 24-7. Not quite, but close. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So. Well, we are coming up on the hour. David, I see that you''ve joined. Do you have anything that you''d like to ask or that you''d like to understand? No, not at this time. I mean, it''s very informative. Looks like everybody''s tracking to the pain points that we''ve encountered. So no, all good. Great. Thank you, David. Robert, anything else on your side? I think I''m good. I think we just need somebody who knows how GFI uses the automate just to make sure there''s no potential issues on that side, which it''s the same company, so I know they''re fixable, but just to validate that, I would say would probably be good. Yeah, I agree. I know Andrew was in another meeting and unable to join us, so I''ll have a follow-up with him. And then I''m assuming at some point we need to get Susan involved in this conversation. I would assume so, because they''re going to have a lot of the workflow of moving stuff from, you know, TD or whatever to this and then into eAutomate. Yeah, and she''s going to know, just so you guys know, too, before we got too involved or took this too far, we wanted to make sure we understood it and saw the fit. But then, you know, next steps for us is probably going to be getting, like, the head of our administration into the conversation who really will know the right questions to ask around the billing and reconciliation and that kind of stuff, because nobody on this call today touches that. And I think it would be important to make sure that she''s comfortable with what the process would look like and what the training would look like for her team so that we could have a seamless process there for both on our side but also the end users. So that''s kind of where I think the biggest question is for us now. But this has been great. I''m your non-technical demo guy, and so this is, Craig, that sounds like definitely Jamie and then maybe someone from Claire''s team you''ll want to have on that call just to make sure they can speak to the implementation and all the data questions. Okay. That sounds great. So Jamie is my SC on the eAutomate side. So he''s from the UK. So if we can look at a time, I''ll find a time next week that''s open in the calendar in the morning if that''ll work for you, some morning next week. Jeff, I can talk with you about it to see what dates work for you guys. But we''ll get Jamie and Claire on a call with your group, whoever that is, the new group, and go over any questions they have. Okay. Okay. Yeah, great. I''ll help you facilitate that, Craig. So let''s just work together to sync schedules. Yep. Sounds good. Any other questions for CJ? This is kind of the layout of integration, but we can get deeper in with Claire also. Yeah, this is high level. Just so everybody knows, implementation timeline typically around six months is safe. We can go faster. We can go slower, but six is a safe one hour a week. You meet with our team, and that would be standard. Okay. Sounds good. Cool. All right, everybody. It''s great to meet you all. Jeff, if you need anything, don''t hesitate to reach out. But yeah, look forward to talking soon. Absolutely. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everybody. Thank you. Thanks, everybody.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good, how are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, no, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions, so I''ll just let you go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them, no welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question, but essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and ideally I look at, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends, and then they can order, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works. That is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes, yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have and the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert Matt for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your product? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about maybe 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, you all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works a lot of the shops out there, and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs, and I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said, so very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here, and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

Thank you. How are we doing today?

I''m doing well. The connection isn''t very good. I''m having a hard time hearing you.

Okay. Can you hear me now?

Yeah, that''s better.

All right. And Sue, it looks like you''re working with Action. Is that correct?

Correct. Yes.

Okay. And how can we assist?

We''re not able to get into the system today.

Unable to log in?

Yes.

Okay. To McCullough, right?

Correct.

Is everyone receiving an error message or?

It''s coming up with a login screen. Usually it just authenticates and it pulls up. But it''s saying that we need to log in. And then when we try to log in, we''re getting an error message.

What''s the error say?

Hold on one sec.

And this is everyone?

Yes.

Oh, wow. Okay.

Now I''m not getting an error message, but it just says authentication authorization required by HTTP. PGSQL says username, password. We enter in our username and password and it just keeps going in. And then when I tried to get into the McCullough local and logging in, it just says login failed.

Okay. So this sounds like, so you''re remoting into a server and then that''s what you''re using to get into McCullough, right?

Yes.

Okay. Have you talked to your IT about the server?

Yes. And he confirmed that both the domain server and the SQL server are up and communicating.

Domain and SQL server are communicating. Okay. Did they do any recent updates or anything that could push us in this direction?

No, just logged in or just walked in today?

No, just walked in today and nobody can get in. We had a power outage. So we thought maybe that had something to do with it, but he got into his office and confirmed that SQL and domain servers are up and communicating and nothing else is affected.

Okay. That is interesting here. Let''s go ahead. I''d like to remote in soon and take a look, but I am actually getting, you called at such a good time. So what I''m going to do, I''m going to cancel my next meeting. I want to help you guys here. So what number can I give you? I''m going to call you back in about two minutes. 5204 work for you or do you prefer the 4195 extension 204?

Yeah, the 5204, the 508212, 5204. Yes, that number works.

Give me two minutes here. I''m going to give you a call back and I''m going to remote in. We''ll get started. All right.

Do we need to have the IT guy on available too?

Yeah, just so we can see what''s going on there.

Should I have him remote in at the same time on my machine? Can that be possible?

Can you both remote in? I''m not sure. Usually what we''ll do is we''ll just, are they internal? Are they close by or do you have to call out to those guys?

No, we have to call out.

Okay. Yeah, we''ll get them all aligned and then if needed, I can remote into his workstation. I think he can remote into yours. So we''ll get that all squared here. All right. I will give you a call back in about two minutes or so here. All right.

What''s your name?

It''s Reginald. I''m going to send you an email.

Okay, Reginald.

The case ID as well. All right. I will give you a call back here. Thanks.

And how can we help? So last week, my call is software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC. I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem. But I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized. And the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose maximize on the taskbar. And it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client. And that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates, about that time. That may be a coincidence. Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben. I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your... Let''s see. What company are you working with again? I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the manager MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO. Okay. Let me try to find... And you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients. Or they''re a tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me... Let''s see. So Clarksville is the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay. So you do have me there from a previous support. Perfect. Okay. Now I need to get this case created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay. So yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9.310. 310. Okay. All right. Sounds good. So it sounds like Windows Update issue caused window issues. So... Yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows Update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah, I''m leaning there with you. Typically, there''s a couple of... I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots, and I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares, and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression is a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything? Like not opening? Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar. And so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when the function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but you have the search function. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server. Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been. Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Okay. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I guess I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. It''s a little bit behind, but that''s okay. Although I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, or platform requirements. Okay. Okay, and then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details, but it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? If that documentation is pretty straightforward, so is it just a client upgrade or do we need to upgrade the server database or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported operating systems and all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review? I see that you called in the past support articles. Let me, I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start the case there, but I don''t remember creating a case or a account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need? Yeah, let me just make sure. Ben.illiam.twinoakstech.com. That''s your. That''s correct. Yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles. If you need access, it sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, just shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t? Okay.

If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah, just go and do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay.

Hey Justin, this is Hannah over at ECI Manufacturing. How are you? I''m good. How are you? I''m doing well. I just wanted to touch base quickly about Job Boss Squared, if you have a moment. About what? Job Boss Squared. Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah. Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was. Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabee, who is a friend of my partner''s. And that''s all I really know about it. And, you know, I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things. And I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess, you know, what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird. It''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay. Kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. So it''s, I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves. And then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people. And then it became, you know, more of a focus. And so I guess it is, you know, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So like I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay. Yeah. That''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and, you know, through the process can help you determine if either Job Boss Squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay. That''s great. Okay. Yeah. No, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions. I''ll just let you go ahead. Where are we going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand, like, is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have, you know, again, we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deeper edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding is kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. But so I don''t know if this is answering the question, but it''s essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and, you know, two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, you know, ideally I look at, you know, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work, you know, comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends and then they can order, you know, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Like, is it smart? Does it know when someone uploads, if I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And Job Boss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for Job Shop Squared? For Job Boss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more in that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works with a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend''s shop. It''s very possible. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said, so very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking, too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here, and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

Let''s take a look. So when you log in in the morning, you log into your Windows environment and then. Yeah, so the first Internet Explorer option there. Yeah, there you go. Okay. So this is how you would begin to log in and this is where it''s failing for you? Yeah, usually we don''t get this. So if I can close this window. Let''s see. Usually we''ll come in, open up Internet Explorer. We have the shortcut up here. Click on that and it opens. So today everybody''s getting the sign-in requirement. Okay.

You click on the link to go straight to McCullough. If you can hold on for one second, the IT guy is calling in on my other phone. Okay. Sounds good. Hey, Justin. Somebody here? Okay. I got McCullough''s on the line now. So should I tell him that? Okay. All right. I''m going to put you on hold or. Okay. Hello. Hey, Reginald. I don''t know if you could hear part of that conversation, but the IT guy is saying that there''s someone on site here has plugged in a Netgear appliance and it''s conflicting with the domain server. So that''s, he believes it''s what''s causing this authentication issue, but he said it''s not a McCullough issue. Yeah. I was going to say, yeah, this doesn''t feel McCullough-y. It feels kind of more network server related. Is there, the number that you called me, is that something where I can call you back if we''re not able to resolve it? It''s best to just shoot me an email if you can. I sent you an email through that case ID and that''ll go to my personal inbox and that''ll light up. So if you respond to that saying, hey Reg, we''re all set. Let me just make sure I got it in here. Okay. At the support. Yeah. Yep. We''ll take care of you there if you respond. So let me know. Yeah. Keep me posted. I figured that was the route it was going to go. It''s before it gets to the actual application. It sounds network-y or server related. Okay. Well, thanks for getting right on that.

The conversation involves troubleshooting a technical issue where a user is unable to log into an application due to an authentication problem. The support representative, Reginald, guides the user through establishing a remote connection to investigate the issue and identifies that the problem is likely related to a network conflict caused by a Netgear appliance.

**Key Points:**  
• **Establishing Remote Support Connection:**  
  Reginald instructs the user to visit fastsupport.gotoassist.com, enter their name, and input a session key to enable remote access for troubleshooting.

• **Identifying the Issue:**  
  The user reports a Windows security prompt appearing during login, which is unusual. Reginald confirms this is not typical behavior and suspects the issue is network-related rather than application-specific.

• **Root Cause and Resolution Plan:**  
  The IT team identifies a Netgear appliance causing a conflict with the domain server, leading to the authentication issue.

And how can we help? So last week, my call of software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC, I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem, but I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized, and the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose Maximize from the taskbar, and it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client, and that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates, about that time. That may be a coincidence, but... Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of, yeah, kind of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben, just in case, I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your, let''s see, what company are you working with again? The company, I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the managed or MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO, okay. Let me try to find, and you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients, or their tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me, let''s see, so Clarksville''s the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay, so you do have me there from a previous support. Perfect. Okay, now I need to get these created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay, so yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9.310. 310, okay. All right, sounds good. So it sounds like Windows Update issue caused window issues. So, yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows Update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah, I''m leaning there with you. Typically, there''s a couple of, I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots, and I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares, and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression''s a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything, like not opening? Well, we had a problem. Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar, and so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when the function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but you have the search functionality. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server. Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been. Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Okay. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with.

I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay.

Hello.

Could you repeat that, please? I''m having a hard time. I''m not sure about my connection.

My name is Reginald. Hi, Reginald.

Hi, Reginald.

Hey, Susan. How are you doing? All right, perfect. Okay, let''s get started here. If you can head to our fastsupport.gotoassist.com.

Let''s see. So it''s file support.

It''s fast, F-A-S-T, support.

Fast support.

Dot.

Dot.

Go to.

Yeah.

Assist.com. That''s the longest website you''ll type in today here. Fastsupport.gotoassist.

All right. Establish support connection.

Yes. And it starts with your name, and then I''ll have a session key for you.

Okay.

Session key is 447-653.

447-653.

I''m sorry. 447-653-579.

579.

Okay.

All right. Okay, I can see your screen. Let''s take a look at what you are seeing. So see your McCullough icon at the very bottom there.

Yeah, that''s the local. And then on the Internet Explorer is the browser.

Okay, so let''s see here. Let''s take a look. So when you log in in the morning, you log into your Windows environment, and then.

Yeah, so the first Internet Explorer option there. Yeah, there you go.

Okay, so this is how you would begin to log in, and this is where it''s failing for you?

Yeah, usually we don''t get this. So if I can close this window. Let''s see. Nope, come on. Usually we''ll come in, open up Internet Explorer. We have the shortcut up here. Click on that, and it opens. So today everybody''s getting the sign-in requirement.

Okay, let me take a screenshot of this screen. It looks like a Windows security prompt. Okay, so then if you try to put in, so you''ve never had to do this before, right? You click on the link, it used to go straight to McCullough, but right now you''re getting.

If you can hold on for one second, the IT guy''s calling in on my other phone.

Okay, sounds good.

Hey, Justin. Somebody here? Okay, I got McCullough''s on the line now. So should I tell him that? Okay, all right. I''m going to put you on, you want me to put you on hold or? Okay. Hello.

Hey, Reginald, I don''t know if you could hear part of that conversation, but the IT guy is saying that there''s someone on site here has plugged in a Netgear appliance, and it''s conflicting with the domain server. So that''s, he believes it''s what''s causing this authentication issue, but he said it''s not a McCullough issue, it''s something.

Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, this doesn''t feel McCullough-y, it feels kind of more network server related.

Is there, the number that you called me, is that something where I can call you back if we''re not able to resolve it?

It''s probably, it''s best to just shoot me an email if you can on that. I sent you an email through that case ID, and that''ll go to my personal inbox, and that''ll light up. So if you respond to that saying, hey Reg, we''re all set.

Let me just make sure I got it in here. Okay, at the support.

Yeah, yep, we''ll take care of you there if you respond. So let me know, yeah, keep me posted. I figured that was the route it was going to go. It''s before it gets to the actual application, it sounds network-y or server related.

Okay, well, thanks for getting right on that, we appreciate it.

No problem, thank you, and have a good one.

Thanks, bye.

Thanks, bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
The conversation involves a troubleshooting session between Reginald and Susan regarding an issue with accessing a McCullough application. They work through the steps to establish a remote support connection, identify the problem, and determine that the issue is related to a network conflict caused by a Netgear appliance, rather than the McCullough application itself.

**Key Points:**  
• **Establishing Remote Support Connection:**  
  Reginald guides Susan through connecting to a remote support session via fastsupport.gotoassist.com using a session key.

• **Identifying the Issue:**  
  Susan explains that users are encountering a Windows security prompt when trying to access the McCullough application, which is unusual. Reginald confirms the issue is not directly related to the application.

• **Root Cause and Next Steps:**  
  Susan relays information from her IT team that a Netgear appliance is causing a conflict with the domain server, leading to authentication issues.

And how can we help? So last week, my call of software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC, I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem. But I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized. And the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose maximize on the taskbar. And it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client. And that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates, about that time. That may be a coincidence. Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben. I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your... Let''s see. What company are you working with again? I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the manager MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO. Okay. Let me try to find... And you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients. Or their tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me... Let''s see. So Clarksville is the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay. So you do have me there from a previous support. Perfect. Okay. Now I need to get these created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay. So yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9 dot, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9 dot 310. 310. Okay. All right. Sounds good. So it sounds like Windows Update issue caused window issues. So... Yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows Update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah. I''m leaning there with you. Typically, there''s a couple of... I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots, and I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares, and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression is a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything? Like not opening? Well, we had a problem. Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar. And so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but yeah, the search functionally. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server... Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Okay. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with.

Thank you. How are we doing today?

I''m doing well. The connection isn''t very good. I''m having a hard time hearing you.

Okay. Can you hear me now?

Yeah, that''s better.

All right. And Sue, it looks like you''re working with Action. Is that correct?

Correct. Yes.

Okay. And how can we assist?

We''re not able to get into the system today.

Unable to log in?

Yes.

Okay. To McCullough, right? What are you...

Correct.

Is everyone receiving an error message or...

It''s coming up with a login screen. Usually it just authenticates and it pulls up. But it''s saying that we need to log in. And then when we try to log in, we''re getting an error message.

What''s the error say?

Hold on one sec.

And this is everyone?

Yes.

Oh, wow. Okay.

Now I''m not getting an error message, but it just says authentication authorization required by HTTP, PGSQL, username, password. We enter in our username and password and it just keeps going in. And then when I try to get into the McCullough local and logging in, it just says login failed.

Okay. So this sounds like... So you''re remoting into a server and then that''s what you''re using to get into McCullough, right?

Yes.

Okay. Have you talked to your IT about the server?

Yes. And he confirmed that both the domain server and the SQL server are up and communicating.

Domain and SQL server are communicating. Okay. Did they do any recent updates or anything that could push us in this direction?

No, just logged in or just walked in today?

No, just walked in today and nobody can get in. We had a power outage. So we thought maybe that had something to do with it, but he got into his office and confirmed that SQL and domain servers are up and communicating and nothing else is affected.

Okay. That is interesting here. Let''s go ahead. I''d like to remote in soon and take a look, but I am actually getting... You called at such a good time.

Yeah, the 5204, the 508212. 5204. Yes, that number works.

Give me two minutes here. I''m going to give you a call back and I''m going to remote in. We''ll get started. All right.

Do we need to have the IT guy on available too?

Yeah, just so we can see what''s going on there.

Should I have him remote in at the same time on my machine? Can that be possible?

Can you both remote in? I''m not sure. Usually what we''ll do is we''ll just... Are they internal? Are they close by or do you have to call out to those guys?

No, we have to call out.

Okay. Yeah, we''ll get them all aligned and then if needed, I can remote into his workstation. I think he can remote into yours. So we''ll get that all squared here. All right. I will give you a call back in about two minutes or so here. All right.

And how can we help? So last week, my call of software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC, I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem, but I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized, and the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose Maximize from the taskbar, and it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client, and that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates about that time. That may be a coincidence, but... Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of, yeah, kind of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben, just in case, I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your, let''s see, what company are you working with again? The company, I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the managed or MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO, okay. Let me try to find, and you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients, or their tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me, let''s see, so Clarksville''s the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay, so you do have me there from a previous report. Perfect. Okay, now I need to get this case created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay, so yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9.310. 310, okay. All right, sounds good. So it sounds like Windows Update issue caused window issues. Yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows Update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah, I''m leaning there with you. Typically, there''s a couple of, I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots, and I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares, and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression''s a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything, like not opening? Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar, and so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but yeah, the search functionally. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server... Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Okay. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I guess I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. It''s a little bit behind, but that''s okay. Although I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, or platform requirements. Okay. Okay, and then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details, but it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? That documentation is pretty straightforward. So is it just a client upgrade, or do we need to upgrade the server database, or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported, operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review? I see that you called in the past support articles. Let me... I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start the case there, but I don''t remember creating a case or an account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need... Yeah, let me just make sure. Ben.illiam at twinoakstech.com. That''s your... That''s correct. Yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, just shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t? Okay. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might find out. Okay. Looks like you submitted cases in the past, so I think you do have access. You should be good. Let me see if I can just... Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah, just go and do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay, I got the portal. You see your request or you see your password? Nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. I''ll put it in my password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right. I''m going to send you an email right now with all this good info. Okay. Yep, I''m in the customer portal now, so I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information.

Sue Proya.

Thank you. How are we doing today?

I''m doing well. The connection isn''t very good. I''m having a hard time hearing you.

Okay. Can you hear me now?

Yeah, that''s better.

All right. And Sue, it looks like you''re working with Action. Is that correct?

Correct. Yes.

Okay. And how can we assist?

We''re not able to get into the system today.

Unable to log in?

Yes.

Okay. To McCullough, right?

Correct.

Is everyone receiving an error message or?

It''s coming up with a login screen. Usually it just authenticates and it pulls up. But it''s saying that we need to log in. And then when we try to log in, we''re getting an error message.

What''s the error say?

Hold on one sec.

And this is everyone?

Yes.

Oh, wow. Okay.

Now I''m not getting an error message, but it just says authentication authorization required by HTTP, PGSQL, username, password. We enter in our username and password and it just keeps going in. And then when I tried to get into the McCullough local and logging in, it just says login failed.

Okay. So this sounds like, so you''re remoting into a server and then that''s what you''re using to get into McCullough, right?

Yes.

Okay. Have you talked to your IT about the server?

Yes. And he confirmed that both the domain server and the SQL server are up and communicating.

Domain SQL server are communicating. Okay. Did they do any recent updates or anything that could push us in this direction?

No, just logged in or just walked in today?

No, just walked in today and nobody can get in. We had a power outage. So we thought maybe that had something to do with it, but he got into his office and confirmed that SQL and domain servers are up and communicating and nothing else is affected.

Okay. That is interesting here. Let''s go ahead. I''d like to remote in Sue and take a look, but I am actually getting, you called at such a good time. So what I''m going to do, I''m going to cancel my next meeting. I want to help you guys here. Sue, what number can I give you? I''m going to call you back in about two minutes. 5204 work for you or do you prefer the 4195 extension 204?

Yeah, the 5204, the 508212, 5204. Yes, that number works.

Give me two minutes here. I''m going to give you a call back and I''m going to remote in. We''ll get started. All right.

Do we need to have the IT guy on available too?

Yeah, just so we can see what''s going on there.

Should I have him remote in at the same time on my machine? Can that be possible?

Can you both remote in? I''m not sure. Usually what we''ll do is we''ll just, are they internal? Are they close by or do you have to call out to those guys?

No, we have to call out.

Okay. Yeah, we''ll get them all aligned and then if needed, I can remote into his workstation. I think he can remote into yours. So we''ll get that all squared here. All right. I will give you a call back in about two minutes or so here. All right.

What''s your name?

It''s Reginald. I''m going to send you an email.

Okay, Reginald.

The case ID as well. All right. I will give you a call back here. Thanks.

And how can we help? So last week, my call of software progression, Clarksville, Tennessee, Economic Development Council, EDC, I think on the older version, we haven''t updated in a long time, so that might be part of the problem, but I think when Windows updates came out, the client will not restore to a Windows size. It goes minimized, and the only way I found to recover it is to right-click and choose Maximize from the taskbar, and it does it on the server as a workstation or on the client, and that just started after the last round of Microsoft updates, about that time. That may be a coincidence, but... Yeah, I know those Microsoft updates have caused a lot of, yeah, kind of weird issues with fonts and things of that nature. Let me go ahead, Ben, just in case, I don''t want to lose you. I want to pull up your information in case I drop. I can give you a call back here. What is your, let''s see, what company are you working with again? The company, I''m with Twin Oaks. We''re the managed or MSP for Clarksville Economic Development Council. Okay. Okay. Nicole Kincaid, does that sound familiar? She''s our COO. COO, okay. Let me try to find, and you do use McCullough progression. Do you know what version you''re on by chance? So we don''t use it directly. Clarksville does. They''re one of our clients, or their tech support company. So the version they have, and I''ve got the license number if you need it. Okay. Let me, let''s see, so Clarksville''s the client. Is it Clarksville Lumber? Economic Development Council or EDC. There we go. Okay, so you do have me there from a previous support. Perfect. Okay, now I need to get these created. That was stressing me out a little bit there. So make sure if I drop, I can give you a call back. Okay, so yeah, go ahead. Which license there? It''s got a license number on the splash screen of 11753. It should be like a 7.9, like a McCullough version. Yeah, it''s 7.9.310. 310, okay. All right, sounds good. So it sounds like Windows Update issue caused window issues. So, yeah. Cool. I''m suspecting that it''s a Windows Update issue, but it just happened to coincide about that time. Yeah, I''m leaning there with you. Typically, there''s a couple of, I have a couple of help articles here where there''s screenshots, and I think you just run through a couple of steps to like re-trigger the window. I work in three different softwares, and the way you troubleshoot this is kind of similar. You basically kind of change the focus of that, the way it defaults, that window defaults. Let me see, because I know progression''s a little different. Okay. All right. Is it crashing or anything, like not opening? Well, we had a problem. Well, we thought it wasn''t opening. It was just showing in the taskbar, and so I found a workaround. meaning to maximize the window. And he''s able to work in it. He said something. Let me see. He replied and said one thing wasn''t working. Let me see. Still having window frame issues with McCullough pop-ups. When I get the lookup function, the window blinks quickly in and out of existence. And McCullough seems to be waiting on my response. Yeah, I got you here. And that''s when... The function''s not opening a window? Yes. He calls it a lookup function, but yeah, the search functionally. What version are you guys using now? Is it 11 or 10? The server... Okay, the workstation he''s on. Let me just verify. We''ve been upgrading everybody to 11. Okay. Clarksville. And it has been... Let me just confirm his computer had been upgraded. Clarksville, Shannon. Shannon Green. Yeah, his new one''s a Windows 11 Pro 24H2. Windows 11. Okay. And the server it does it on as well, which is Server 2016. So it''s the same. 2016 server. Give me a second. I''m going to actually write that down. 2016 server. Okay. Windows 11. There could be some compatibility issues as well. There''s a couple of things that I''ve seen fall out through this update. So let me just double check some areas. Okay. Quickly here. I''ve seen an article that talks about how to troubleshoot it, but let''s just make sure it''s compatible. 310. There''s a bunch of stuff going on in 310 here. Looks like some hot fixes, some things of that nature. Did you take the hot fix already for 310? No. This is one software we haven''t done much upgrading. It didn''t seem like there was a particular upgrade cycle we were familiar with. So if that''s something we need to do or work, I guess, I presume there''s an update for this client. So if that''s something we need to do. There''s about five or six new releases there. It''s a little bit behind, but that''s okay. Although I''ll send you the details if you''re interested in upgrading and all that. I just want to look at the supported platforms, just make sure we''re good. So 310 is not supported by Windows 11. Interesting. So 310 can only go to Windows 10. Okay. That''s probably causing some issues there. I''ll send you an article with this requirement page as well, or platform requirements. Okay. Okay, and then I''ll also send you another article that talks about if you run into some more of those Windows issues down the road. So I''ll send you all these good details, but it looks to be just the compatibility supported platform there. All right. Okay. Well, is there anything else I can look into for you? That documentation is pretty straightforward. So is it just a client upgrade, or do we need to upgrade the server database, or is it all included in that process? I would look at the supported platforms. There''s an installation guide as well that kind of walks you through all that good stuff. Okay. But yeah, I mean, there''s a checklist of things just that you can reference, like your database engines, which are supported, operating systems, all that good stuff. So I''ll send it your way. Do you have access to review? I see that you called in the past support articles. Let me... I''m not sure if I have an account. I did go to the support page to start the case there, but I don''t remember creating a case or an account with y''all before. So to review these articles, do I need... Yeah, let me just make sure. Ben.illiam.twinoakstech.com. That''s your... That''s correct. Yes. Okay. I''m going to send you these articles if you need access. It sounds like you have access to the customer portal, so you should be good. But if you have any issues, just shoot me an email. I don''t know if I do. Oh, you don''t? Okay. I haven''t logged into it, in other words, so I''m not sure. If I can just do the forgot password option and do that, I might find out. Okay. Looks like you submitted cases in the past, so I think you do have access. You should be good. Let me see if I can just... Should I do the forgot password on the customer portal page? If you''re not sure what the password is, yeah, just go and do that. Okay. I''ll do that. Just make sure I can get to the stuff you''re sending me. Oh, you''re okay. If not, then I''ll turn it on for you. No problem. Okay, I got the portal. You see your request, reset your password. Nice, nice. It knows you. It''s in there for you. Good deal. All right. Let''s do this. I''ll put it in my password vault. How about that? Customer portal. All right, I''m going to send you an email right now with all this good info. Okay. Yep, I''m in the customer portal now, so I''ll go through that then. Sounds good. Let me get everything situated. Okay, Ben. Yeah, I''ll go ahead. I''ll send you all this good information. If you need anything else, create a case, reach out, and we''ll take care of you. But thanks for giving us some time today. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one. Bye. You too.

Ben contacted senior support to address an issue with McCullough Progression software used by the Clarksville Economic Development Council.

About what?

Job Boss Squared.

Oh, Job Boss Squared. Yeah.

Doing some research and just wanted to kind of see what the scope and nature of that was.

Yeah, so I have a new manufacturing company that''s starting up. We''re kind of a product development center and we don''t have any management tools yet in place for anything for the shop floor or estimating or really anything, any systems for any of that stuff. You guys were recommended, the platform was recommended by John Mabey, who is a friend of my partner''s and that''s all I really know about it. I was actually looking at another platform that was specifically designed to do quoting for sheet metal and some other things and I saw that it integrated with Job Boss as well. So I guess what I''m really looking for is I need a solution that''s going to help me to estimate and then manage production of stuff throughout our whole facility. And it''s kind of weird, it''s a broad facility. We have milling, laser tube, laser sheet, water jet, powder coating, welding, press break, tons of stuff. Okay, kind of like a true job shop environment? It is and it isn''t. I mean, we have all this stuff and we got it to make cool things for ourselves and then in the midst of that, a bunch of people needed stuff and we thought, oh, we might as well make parts for people and then it became more of a focus. So I guess it is, now we are sort of, I guess we''re moving in that direction into more of a job shoppy sort of mindset. So I don''t have a background in being a job shop. I''m a designer who ended up with a big factory. So I really don''t know a whole lot about how other shops run. Okay, that''s okay. That''s kind of where we step in and we help with the educational piece and through the process can help you determine if either job off squared or something in our arsenal can help you or if there''s something else that we''re aware of as a resource that we can point you in that direction. So happy to kind of step in and help you understand the lay of the land a little bit better. Okay, that''s great. Okay. Yeah, you can keep going. I could ask a million questions, so I''ll just let you. Go ahead, where were you going to go? To kind of help wrap my head around things. So maybe headcount or who all is involved with the shop would help me understand like is it multiple departments or just kind of a small crew? Right now it''s a small crew, but it''s going to grow into multiple departments. So we have one department that I can just sort of consider like raw metal production. So I''ve got laser tube cutter, laser sheet cutter, press break, deburr, edge rounding machine, stuff where like I''ve got a lot of friends and people that are fabricators that will use us just to make parts for them. No welding or anything, just raw parts. Then we have a mill and a lathe, and that''s kind of like its own little department. Then we have a water jet, which is sort of kind of its own little department too. And then powder coating will be its own department. Stone production will be its own department. And then welding kind of serves just the fabrication business, actually building specific things for people. So I don''t know if this is answering the question, but essentially, yeah, we''ll have leaders over each department at some point. But right now we''re just like eight, nine guys and two guys, one engineer, myself as a designer slash engineer, and then kind of an operations guy. I''ve got outside sales guys that are dying to come in and work with us, but I don''t have any systems in place for them. Oh, as far as like a CRM or estimating, quoting, that kind of thing? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and ideally I look at, I don''t know if you''re familiar with companies like Oshkosh or SendCutSend. A lot of their work comes through a web portal where customers can upload a piece of sheet metal. They can see all the bends, and then they can order, they can add other processes to their order. So they have like a visualizer where you can see their 3D part online. Ultimately, that''s what I''d like to get to. The work I''m really going to try to go get is just the raw processing of tube and sheet. This is where I really want to focus at first. So I''m not sure where your software comes in. Is it smart? Does it know? If I upload an assembly, does it break it all apart and let you know that you have sheet and tube and mill parts? So part of an assembly would be what they call like the BOM, the bill of materials, right? And that kind of has the breakdown of everything. I''m not an expert on how that all, like the ins and outs of how it works, but that is definitely part of an ERP system. Yeah. Is the inventory management side of things. And that''s you guys, right? You would be an ERP. Yes. Yeah. So we represent ERP solutions. They''re all under our umbrella. So we have various kinds, just kind of depending on the type of manufacturing, because as I''m sure you know, it''s a very broad industry. And JobBoss Squared does sound in line with the type of shop that you have, the machinery and processes that you''re performing there. Okay. So we''re at least on the right track there. Now, as far as kind of like getting more into the nitty gritty of how it works or how well it would complement the type of goals that you have and structure of your shop, that I would place you in touch with our expert, Matt, for. Okay. Okay. And what''s the cost basis for JobShop Squared? For JobBoss Squared, I don''t know that I have exact numbers, but just kind of an understanding that it is based for small to midsize shops. So it''s kind of more on that like starter price range. It''s not an enterprise solution for these giant corporations or anything like that. So what''s the lowest entry point level and what''s the range that people will spend for your products? That you''ll have to talk to Matt about because I''m not really sure. I''m not seeing anything here on that. Okay. And do you all just have the one location? It''s in Carlsbad. Carlsbad. Yeah, we have one location in Carlsbad. We''re about 18,000 square feet. Oh, I''m sorry. Yeah, y''all are in California, aren''t you? Yeah. I don''t know why I got it twisted in my head thinking Washington. No, we''re in San Diego. My apologies. That''s actually Holly Greiner, who''s the expert for your region. She works a lot of the shops out there and she''s, gosh, a wealth of knowledge. She''s been around several decades with this system. Awesome. So she definitely knows all the ins and outs. And I don''t know if she might even be working with your friend shop. She probably is. I know my friend had wanted to introduce me to somebody. I think Holly might have been the name that he said. So very possible. Let me see here. It looks like she might be available right now. If you want, if you have a few minutes, I can reach out to her and then have her call you directly and then kind of get things hashed out a little bit further. Sure, yeah. Okay. And I was typing as we were talking too, so I can kind of give her the rundown of things. That way you don''t have to repeat yourself so much. Yeah, that''s no problem. I don''t mind. Okay. Well, let me get in touch with her, Justin. Just hang tight on your phone here and hopefully she''ll be calling you here soon. Okay. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Take care. Okay. You too.

Hello. Is the test support still available?

Could you repeat that please? I''m having a hard time. I''m not sure about my connection.

My name is Reginald. Hi Reginald. Perfect. Okay, let''s get started here. If you can head to our fastsupport.gotoassist.com

Let''s see. So it''s file support. It''s fast, F-A-S-T, support. Fast support. .go to assist.com. That''s the longest website you''ll type in today here. Fastsupport.gotoassist.com. All right.

Let''s take a look at what you are seeing. So see your McCullough icon at the very bottom there. Yeah, that''s the local. And then on the Internet Explorer is the browser. Okay. So let''s see here. Let''s take a look. So when you log in in the morning, you log into your Windows environment and then... Yeah, so the first Internet Explorer option there. Yeah, there you go. Okay. So this is how you would begin to log in and this is where it''s failing for you? Yeah, usually we don''t get this. So if I can close this window. Let''s see. Nope, go on. Usually we''ll come in, open up Internet Explorer. We have the shortcut up here. Click on that and it opens. So today everybody''s getting the sign-in requirement. Okay. Let me take a screenshot of this screen. It looks like a Windows security prompt. Okay. So then if you try to put in... So you''ve never had to do this before, right? You click on the link and it used to go straight to McCullough. Reginald, if you can hold on for one second, the IT guy is calling in on my other phone. Okay. Sounds good. Hey, Justin. Somebody here? Okay. I got McCullough''s on the line now. So should I tell him that... Okay. All right. I''m going to put you on... You want me to put you on hold or... Okay. Hello. Hey, Reginald. I don''t know if you could hear part of that conversation, but the IT guy is saying that there''s someone on site here has plugged in a Netgear appliance and it''s conflicting with the domain server. So that''s... He believes it''s what''s causing this authentication issue, but he said it''s not a McCullough issue. Yeah. I was going to say, yeah, this doesn''t feel McCullough-y. It feels kind of more network server related. Is there... The number that you called me, is that something where I can call you back if we''re not able to resolve it? It''s best to just shoot me an email if you can. I sent you an email through that case ID and that''ll go to my personal inbox and that''ll light up. So if you respond to that saying, hey, Reg, we''re all set. Let me just make sure I got it in here. Okay. At the support. Yeah. Yep. We''ll take care of you there if you respond. So let me know. Yeah. Keep me posted. I figured that was the route it was going to go. It''s before it gets to the actual application. It sounds network-y or server related. Okay. Well, thanks for getting right on that. We appreciate it. No problem. Thank you and have a good one. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye.', NULL, '**Conversation Summary:**  
The conversation involves a technical support session where Reginald seeks assistance with an issue related to accessing a system. The support representative helps Reginald troubleshoot the problem, identifies a network-related issue caused by a Netgear appliance, and provides guidance for follow-up communication.

**Key Points:**  
• **Establishing Support Connection:**  
  Reginald connects to the support session via fastsupport.gotoassist.com, shares a session key, and allows the representative to view his screen for troubleshooting.  

• **Troubleshooting the Issue:**  
  The issue involves a Windows security prompt that users encounter when trying to access the McCullough application. The representative confirms that this is unusual and takes a screenshot for further analysis.  

• **Identifying the Root Cause:**  
  The IT team identifies the problem as a network conflict caused by a Netgear appliance interfering with the domain server, not an issue with the McCullough application.
