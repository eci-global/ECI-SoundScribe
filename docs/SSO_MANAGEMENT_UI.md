## How It Works

### Enabling SSO for a User

**Before:**
- User can sign in with email/password OR Okta (both work)

**After Enabling SSO:**
- User can ONLY sign in with Okta
- Password field is hidden on login page
- Attempting password login shows error message

### Disabling SSO for a User

**Before:**
- User must use Okta SSO

**After Disabling SSO:**
- User can use email/password OR Okta (both work)
- Password field appears on login page

### Bulk Domain Enable

Example: Enable SSO for all `@techcorp.com` users
1. Enter domain: `techcorp.com`
2. Enter reason: "Corporate security policy"
3. System processes:
   - Finds: alice@techcorp.com, bob@techcorp.com, charlie@techcorp.com
   - Enables SSO for all three
   - Creates audit log entry for each
   - Returns: "Successfully enabled SSO for 3 users. Failed: 0"

---

## User Experience After SSO Enablement

### For Users with SSO Required:

1. **Login Page Behavior:**
   - User enters email address
   - System checks: "Is SSO required for this email?"
   - If YES: Password field disappears
   - Only "Sign in with Okta" button is shown
   - Message displays: "SSO authentication is required for this account"

2. **First Okta Login:**
   - User clicks "Sign in with Okta"
   - Redirected to Okta login page
   - Enters Okta credentials
   - Redirected back to app
   - Account is automatically linked to Okta
   - "Okta Linked" badge appears in admin UI

3. **Subsequent Logins:**
   - User enters email
   - Sees only Okta button
   - Clicks "Sign in with Okta"
   - May be auto-signed in (if Okta session exists)

### For Users with SSO Optional:

- Can choose email/password OR Okta
- Both authentication methods work
- No restrictions

---

## Database Operations

The SSO Management UI interacts with these database tables:

### `user_sso_settings`
```sql
- user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
- sso_required (BOOLEAN) - TRUE = must use Okta
- sso_provider (TEXT) - 'okta' or 'email'
- okta_user_id (TEXT) - Okta's unique user ID
- okta_email (TEXT) - Email from Okta
- okta_groups (TEXT[]) - Okta group memberships
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### `sso_enforcement_log`
```sql
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID) - Affected user
- action (TEXT) - 'enabled', 'disabled', 'login_attempt'
- reason (TEXT) - Why the change was made
- changed_by (UUID) - Admin who made the change
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

---

## API Service Functions Used

The UI uses these functions from `src/services/ssoService.ts`:

### `enableSSORequirement(userId, reason, adminUserId)`
Sets `sso_required = true` for a user and logs the action.

### `disableSSORequirement(userId, reason, adminUserId)`
Sets `sso_required = false` for a user and logs the action.

### `bulkEnableSSOByDomain(domain, reason, adminUserId)`
Enables SSO for all users matching `%@domain`:
```typescript
const result = await bulkEnableSSOByDomain('company.com', 'Policy', adminId);
// Returns: { success: [userId1, userId2], failed: [] }
```

### `checkSSORequired(email)`
Checks if an email address requires SSO:
```typescript
const result = await checkSSORequired('user@company.com');
// Returns: { required: true|false, settings: {...} }
```

---

## Security & Permissions

### Who Can Access?
- **Admin users only** can access `/admin/sso-management`
- Protected by RLS policies on database tables
- Row-level security ensures admins can only manage users in their organization

### What Gets Logged?
Every SSO change creates an audit log entry with:
- What changed (enabled/disabled)
- Who was affected
- Why it was changed
- Who made the change
- When it happened

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No users showing in the table"
**Solution**:
1. Check that users exist in the database
2. Verify admin permissions
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Supabase connection is working

### Issue: "Can't enable SSO for a user"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure reason field is filled in
2. Check that you're logged in as admin
3. Verify user exists and email is valid
4. Check Supabase logs for policy errors

### Issue: "Bulk enable doesn't find any users"
**Solution**:
1. Check domain spelling (don't include `@`)
2. Verify users with that domain exist
3. Example: For `user@company.com`, enter `company.com`

### Issue: "User can still log in with password after enabling SSO"
**Solution**:
1. User needs to log out and back in
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check that `sso_required = true` in database
4. Verify login page is checking SSO requirement

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Workflow:

1. **Pilot Phase (Week 1)**
   - Enable SSO for 3-5 test users
   - Have them test Okta login flow
   - Verify everything works
   - Gather feedback

2. **Department Rollout (Week 2)**
   - Use bulk enable for one department
   - Example: All users with `@sales.company.com`
   - Monitor audit logs for issues

3. **Company-Wide (Week 3+)**
   - Use bulk enable for main company domain
   - Communicate to all users
   - Provide support documentation

4. **Enforcement (Week 4+)**
   - Review which users have linked Okta
   - Follow up with users who haven't
   - Disable password auth exceptions as needed

## Technical Implementation

### Component Location
`src/pages/admin/SSOManagement.tsx`

### Routing
- Admin navigation: `src/admin/routes.tsx`
- App routing: `src/App.tsx` â†’ `/admin/sso-management`

### State Management
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Direct Supabase queries for data loading
- Service functions for mutations

### UI Components
- shadcn/ui components (Card, Table, Dialog, Badge, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide icons for visual elements

### Real-time Updates
Currently uses manual refresh. To add real-time updates:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('sso_settings_changes')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'user_sso_settings'
    }, payload => {
      loadUsers(); // Refresh on any change
    })
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```
